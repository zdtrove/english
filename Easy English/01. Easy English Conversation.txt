DESCRIBING PEOPLE AT A PARTY

Hey Dan. When did you get here?
Oh hi Becca. About 10 minutes ago. You?
We've been here for about an hour.
Did you come with Paul?
Yeah he's over there by the pool table.
Who's that woman he's talking to?
Which one? There are two women talking to him.
The slim young woman with the shoulder length hair. She's wearing a red dress.
Oh, that's Mallory's friend Jess.
She's drop dead gorgeous and she looks very confident. I've never seen her before. How does she know Mallory?
They just started working together so they are co-workers.
I see. And who's that guy over there in front of the TV.
You mean that tall man with dark brown hair. The one wearing a green shirt.
Yeah exactly. He's putting on a CD.
That's Mallory's brother, James.
Really what kind of person is he?
He's a friendly and easy going person. I think he is a college student. Hey have you seen Evan yet?
Yes he's right there. He just got the worst haircut. It looks terrible.
Well I like it I think it suits him. Beauty's in the eye of the beholder I suppose.
Can't argue with that.
Who's a woman dancing with him? She looks like an actress.
I think she said her name is Wendy. She's his new girlfriend.
What's she like?
She is very funny. She makes a lot of jokes. There are many interesting people here. We're going to have a lot of fun.

DESCRIBING A LOST OBJECT

Can you help me?
Sure, what's going on?
My friend and I were just having lunch here, and I think I left my cell phone on the table.
Oh no. Where were you sitting?
We had that table over there the one next to the window.
Okay let me go look.
Thank you.
Sorry, I didn't find it anywhere. Are you sure it was on the table?
Yes, but it could have fallen on the floor I suppose
I'll check again. What does it look like?
It's a black smartphone with a blue case.
Okay, hold on.
Sorry, no I don't see it here.
Oh no.
Let me check in the back. Maybe the busser found it and put it in the lost and found.
Okay thanks.
Hey Mike, when you bussed table 12 did you see a phone on the table?
No sorry.
You sure?
Table 12?
Yeah.
Yeah, I'm sure there wasn't a phone there.
Okay thanks.
Sorry we don't have it in the back.
I don't understand. I had my phone on the table. Then we got up to leave but I don't remember grabbing it. And now it's gone.
Did you try calling it?
Of course! I didn't even think of that!
Here you can use our phone to call.
Thanks.
Wait I hear it ringing.
I got you I had your phone the whole time.
That's not funny!
Your friend had your phone then? 
Yes, I'm so sorry to trouble you.
No problem. I'm glad you found it.

describing a job

hi

you must be kara

nice to meet you

welcome I'm randall the department

supervisor and I'll be conducting your

interview today

before we get started I wanted to

describe the position a bit more please

feel free to ask questions as I go

okay

sounds great it looks like from your

resume that you had the same senior

associate position at your last job is

that right

yes that's correct

well working here might be a bit

different from what you're used to

first of all you will be in charge of 10

other employees

I'm sorry did you say 2 or 10

10.

wow

that's a lot more than at my last job

I thought so

in addition to that you'll be in charge

of training those employees

[Music]

and if I'm honest the training program

here is a bit out of date so we would

like to see you make some changes to

that

when's the last time it was updated

oh I'd say at least five years

okay

no problem

great

now in addition to your usual tasks

drafting memos organizing and attending

meetings etc

you'll also be in charge of our bookings

what's that

we have a space on the second floor that

we use for in-house events like our

fundraisers but when we're not using it

we rent it out

oh

what does that entail

basically if anyone wants to use the

space

you are responsible for making the

arrangements drafting the contract and

so on

we have some contract templates that you

use

okay

I think I can handle that

great

now let's get started

shopping for clothes

[Music]

jason the wedding is saturday and you

still don't have anything to wear

so what that's two days away we have

time to go shopping later

parents

large

large

it's ridiculous

dress

whatever you say

can we go now

hmm let me think you already have a belt

at home right

it's too small okay a new belt

got it

one

rain

don't you just hate it

yeah especially when I'm on vacation

oh

no I'm from portsmouth

you

I'm also here on vacation I'm from

washington

so what's portsmouth like actually it's

usually a lot rainier than this

really

yeah last month I think we had two sunny

days total

the rest was rain rain rain

that's awful

although we have really bad humidity in

washington

I always wanted to visit washington

what's it like

it can get really crowded in the summers

which is also the hottest time of the

year

but I still recommend it

I've heard there's a lot of traffic and

air pollution

it's gotten better over the years

there are some great parks and lots of

green spaces which help with the

pollution

oh that's good

I've never been to portsmouth where is

it again

it's right on the north coast

on the coast

cool

so do you have beaches there

yeah

pebble beaches

a boardwalk

and appear

[Music]

that doesn't sound so bad

I'll have to plan my next trip there

well if you don't like the rain

be sure not to come in the spring

you probably won't be able to enjoy the

beach if it's raining all the time

good to know

thanks
