DESCRIBING PEOPLE AT A PARTY

Hey Dan. When did you get here?
Oh hi Becca. About 10 minutes ago. You?
We've been here for about an hour.
Did you come with Paul?
Yeah he's over there by the pool table.
Who's that woman he's talking to?
Which one? There are two women talking to him.
The slim young woman with the shoulder length hair. She's wearing a red dress.
Oh, that's Mallory's friend Jess.
She's drop dead gorgeous and she looks very confident. I've never seen her before. How does she know Mallory?
They just started working together so they are co-workers.
I see. And who's that guy over there in front of the TV.
You mean that tall man with dark brown hair. The one wearing a green shirt.
Yeah exactly. He's putting on a CD.
That's Mallory's brother, James.
Really what kind of person is he?
He's a friendly and easy going person. I think he is a college student. Hey have you seen Evan yet?
Yes he's right there. He just got the worst haircut. It looks terrible.
Well I like it I think it suits him. Beauty's in the eye of the beholder I suppose.
Can't argue with that.
Who's a woman dancing with him? She looks like an actress.
I think she said her name is Wendy. She's his new girlfriend.
What's she like?
She is very funny. She makes a lot of jokes. There are many interesting people here. We're going to have a lot of fun.

DESCRIBING A LOST OBJECT

Can you help me?
Sure, what's going on?
My friend and I were just having lunch here, and I think I left my cell phone on the table.
Oh no. Where were you sitting?
We had that table over there. The one next to the window.
Okay let me go look.
Thank you.
Sorry, I didn't find it anywhere. Are you sure it was on the table?
Yes, but it could have fallen on the floor I suppose
I'll check again. What does it look like?
It's a black smartphone with a blue case.
Okay, hold on.
Sorry, no I don't see it here.
Oh no.
Let me check in the back. Maybe the busser found it and put it in the lost and found.
Okay thanks.
Hey Mike, when you bussed table 12 did you see a phone on the table?
No sorry.
You sure?
Table 12?
Yeah.
Yeah, I'm sure there wasn't a phone there.
Okay thanks.
Sorry we don't have it in the back.
I don't understand. I had my phone on the table. Then we got up to leave but I don't remember grabbing it. And now it's gone.
Did you try calling it?
Of course! I didn't even think of that!
Here you can use our phone to call.
Thanks.
Wait I hear it ringing.
I got you. I had your phone the whole time.
That's not funny!
Your friend had your phone then? 
Yes, I'm so sorry to trouble you.
No problem. I'm glad you found it.

EXPLAINING WHAT YOU WANT

Hi, my name is Jack. How can I help you?
Oh um hi Jack. I need to get something for my car and I was hoping you could help me.
Of course. You've come to the right place.
Great. I'm having some car trouble and my dad said he could help me with it but he needs to inspect the underside. I don't know what that means but I guess my car didn't come with whatever it is he needs, so he sent me here to buy it.
Okay, what is it that you need to get?
Well the problem is I can't remember what he called it. I'm not sure if this is right but I think the thing is a jack.
Yes I'm Jack what do you need?
That's the thing, jack.
Yes. What thing?
You know the thing that you put under your car.
Can you be more specific?
Well it's like a little machine. It lifts the car up so you can see under it.
Oh! A jack!
That's what I said.
My apologies. I thought you were repeating my name. Yes, that is called a jack and we sell those over here. Let me show you.
Oh good! Thanks so much!

DESCRIBING A JOB

Hi, you must be Cara.
Nice to meet you.
Welcome, I'm Randall the department supervisor and I'll be conducting your interview today. Before we get started I wanted to describe the position a bit more. Please feel free to ask questions as I go.
Okay, sounds great.
It looks like from your resume that you had the same senior associate position at your last job, is that right.
Yes, that's correct.
Well working here might be a bit different from what you're used to. First of all you will be in charge of 10 other employees.
I'm sorry did you say 2 or 10?
10.
Wow, that's a lot more than at my last job.
I thought so. In addition to that you'll be in charge of training those employees. And, if I'm honest, the training program here is a bit out of date. So we would like to see you make some changes to that.
When's the last time it was updated?
Oh I'd say at least five years.
Okay, no problem.
Great. Now in addition to your usual tasks, drafting memos, organizing and attending meetings etc, you'll also be in charge of our bookings.
What's that?
We have a space on the second floor that we use for in-house events, like our fundraisers but when we're not using it, we rent it out.
Oh, what does that entail?
Basically, if anyone wants to use the space, you are responsible for making the arrangements, drafting the contract, and so on. We have some contract templates that you use.
Okay, I think I can handle that.
Great, now let's get started.

============================

SHOPPING FOR CLOTHES

Jason, the wedding is saturday, and you still don't have anything to wear.
So what? That's two days away we have time to go shopping later.
No we don't. I'm working late tomorrow and friday we're having dinner with my parents.
Oh, yeah. Fine, let's get this over with.
I think you should get a suit.
No way! Isn't it an outdoor wedding? I'll get too hot.
You can just take the jacket off.
Why don't I just get a shirt and pants then?
Okay, fine. But you're wearing a tie too.
Ugh! Deal, Now how about these pants?
They're green.
Yeah, and?
They are so ugly, no.
Choose gray or black. 
Gray.
Okay now for a shirt. Oh look this one is on sale.
Cool, let's get it.
Wait, it's a medium, I need a large.
Large, large. Here you go large
Done. Just a tie now. Oh, cool I like this one.
Oh what is that pattern?
It's retro, from the 70s I think.
It's ridiculous. Here, how about this one? It'll match my dress.
Whatever you say. Can we go now?
Hmm let me think, you already have a belt at home right?
It's too small. 
Okay a new belt.
Got it.
No not the brown one! You're wearing gray pants. Are you insane?
All right all right I'll get the black one. Let's go.
Are you sure that's everything?
Yes, oh, wait.
Shoes.

============================

DESCRIBING YOUR HOMETOWN

Rain...rain... Don't you just hate it?
Yeah, especially when I'm on vacation.
Oh, you're not from here?
No, I'm from Portsmouth. You?
I'm also here on vacation. I'm from Washington. So what's Portsmouth like? 
Actually, it's usually a lot rainier than this.
Really?
Yeah, last month I think we had two sunny days total. The rest was rain rain rain.
That's awful. Although we have really bad humidity in Washington.
I always wanted to visit Washington. What's it like?
It can get really crowded in the summers, which is also the hottest time of the year. But I still recommend it.
I've heard there's a lot of traffic and air pollution.
It's gotten better over the years. There are some great parks and lots of green spaces which help with the pollution.
Oh that's good.
I've never been to Portsmouth, where is it again?
It's right on the north coast.
On the coast? Cool! So do you have beaches there?
Yeah. Pebble beaches. A boardwalk, and a pier.
That doesn't sound so bad. I'll have to plan my next trip there!
Well, if you don't like the rain, be sure not to come in the spring! You probably won't be able to enjoy the beach if it's raining all the time.
Good to know! Thanks!

============================

WHAT HAVE YOU BEEN UP TO LATELY

Laura!
Oh my god, Michelle! I didn't expect to see you here!
Neither did I! How long has it been? 7 years? 8?
Too long!
Did you move back?
No, we're just in town for a visit. What about you?
Yeah, I moved back about six months ago.
That's cool.
Well, what have you been up to lately?
Not a lot.
Not a lot? Didn't you have a baby?
Yeah, well, he's not a baby anymore. We had Josh two years ago in december.
Oh wow, two already! Time flies, doesn't it?
It sure does.
So how about work? I heard you got promoted.
Yeah, last month, and it was about time...Wait, how did you know?
Oh I ran into your mom last week at the grocery store.
Really? She must have forgotten to tell me that she saw you. Oh well. What about you? What have you been up to?
I started building a house, actually, so that has been taking up all of my time lately.
Oh wow, I bet! Where are you building it?
On my grandma's land. Well, my land now. She passed away not too long ago. That's why I moved back.
I'm so sorry to hear that. I had no idea. My mom didn't mention that either.
That's okay. You didn't know. But hey, I have to run we should catch up some more while you're in town.
Yes, let's! Is your number the same?
Actually, I got a new number. I told your...
Let me guess, my mom!
Yeah.
Okay no worries. I'll get it from her. I need to call her and have a word with her now anyways...
Okay, sounds good, bye!
