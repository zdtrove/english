Yeah it is. But it's also very rewarding I truly love what I do.
What do you teach? 
I teach mathematics, how about you? What do you do?
I'm a lawyer.
Wow that's a very nice job, what made you choose to be a lawyer?
I love the feeling of standing before the court and protecting people in legal disputes. So my job is very rewarding too.

Hi Dave how are you?
Hi Grandma, I'm fine, just a little tired.
What are you doing?
I'm just doing my math homework and it's a little bit difficult.
Take a short break and get some rest, where is everyone?
Well, everyone is doing something right now.
Oh really, where's your mom?
She's in the kitchen, I think she's baking an apple cake
Oh, how about your dad?
He is fixing the washing machine in the basement, it stops spinning and draining.
I see, and what are your brother and sister doing?
Oh, Kanye's planting some flowers in the garden, and Tony is tidying his room.
So everyone is very busy and hardworking today.

============================

Where shall I put this plant Betty?
Put it on the bookshelf please, on the top is fine, and please put the remote control beside the TV.
But where is the remote control I can't see it.
It's under the table.
Oh yeah I see it now.
There's also a notepad here, where do you usually keep it?
Just put it in one of the drawers in the desk.
The two top drawers are already full of stuff.
You can put it in the bottom drawer, inside that empty box.
Okay. I didn't know you wear glasses, these are yours right?
Yes they're mine I only use them for reading. Please put them in that case on the desk beside the computer.
Do you want me to put this cap away?
Yeah just hang it on the hook behind the door, it will be fine there thanks.
There's a belt lying on the floor here.
Leave it on the chair.
The chair in front of the desk.
That's right.

============================

Where are you from Sandra?
I'm from Birmingham England but I have been working in London for a few years now. I manage a small importing business. What about you?
I'm from Illinois.
Whereabouts in Illinois are you from?
I'm from a tiny town called Paris, not the French version, the Illinois version of course. It's about two to three hours south of Chicago.
Really? That's so interesting. I didn't know there was a town called Paris in US. What's it like? 
Oh I think it's a very boring place, there's nothing to do there: no good restaurants, no nightlife of any kind, I really get bored there.
Oh that's too bad.
Yeah but lots of people love it there because it's so pretty
Yeah?
Uh-huh it has lovely scenery, lots of rivers, lakes, trees.
Well it sounds like a nice place.
Yeah if you like nature but you know I'm a real city person.

============================

Excuse me! Do you know where the international conference on education is going to be held?
Yes, it's going to be held in that room at the end of the hallway. I'm here to attend the same conference. But it seems we've come too early, it starts in half an hour.
Yes I always arrive early everywhere I go.
By the way I'm Phil.
Nice to meet you Phil. I'm Rahi.
Nice to meet you too Rahi.
Where are you from?
I'm from India.
Are you here all by yourself or with your family?
I'm here by myself and I don't know anyone.
Same here. By the way your English is very good for a non-native speaker.
Thank you.
Where did you learn to speak it so well.
Mostly in school, initially from my nanny. I began to study it formally however during my first year of elementary school. Most of my english skills were developed in university. I majored in linguistics and favored English literature for my electives.
Then you must be an english teacher right.
Exactly!
Shall we have a coffee while we wait for the conference to start?
That sounds nice.

============================

Do you have any brothers or sisters Bill?
Yeah, I have an older sister Amy and a younger brother Steven.
Tell me a bit about them.
Amy is 19. She studies business at Columbia university in New York. She's pretty short and has long blonde hair. She has a boyfriend called Joey and talks about him all the time. It gets a bit boring really. Steven is 13 but I think he's very intelligent and he's also the funniest person in our family. He can really make you laugh. He loves animals and keeps a pet rabbit in the garden.
That's very nice, as an only child how I wish I had had siblings. I envy anyone with brothers and sisters.
Well, at least you get all your parents attention.
Yeah, but you have no one to blame.
That's right.
And what your parents do?
My mom is an economist and my dad is an accountant.
Do you get along with your family?
Yes, my parents always support me in everything I want to do. I talk to my parents all the time and have a very open relationship with them. I get along fine with my siblings too even though we have pretty different personalities.
Well you are very fortunate to have such a great family.
Yes, I am. I'm very thankful for that.

============================

Excuse me can you help me out?
Sure, what do you need?
Thanks, I'm a new student here and I can't find my classroom.

Hi I'm Mia, nice to meet you.
By the way, how long does science class last?
Every class lasts 50 minutes. Then we have a 10 minute break.
Are you in any clubs?
Yes I am. I love basketball and I'm in the basketball team. Basketball club is on thursdays after school. Matches are usually on saturday mornings. I'm also in the school orchestra. I can play the violin very well now.
Oh, I'd like to join the orchestra too. When do you practice?
We practice at lunch time in the auditorium on tuesdays and sometimes we have concerts.
Where's the auditorium?
I'll show you later. Oh hey we'd better get a glass, it starts in five minutes.

============================

Linda can I borrow your eraser?
Sure here you can keep it.
Thanks. How did you do on the math test?
I totally bombed it. It was very hard I should have studied more. I'll probably have to take a re-test.
I'm in the same boat, I'm pretty sure I failed it.
I studied so hard for the test but all of my efforts just went down the terrain.
I know exactly how you feel. Why don't we study together for the retest?
That's a great idea, if we put our heads together I'm sure we can do better.

============================

Thank you for the dinner Alice it was delicious and I thoroughly enjoyed it. You are an excellent cook.
Thank you. So the steak was okay? It wasn't too salty?
No it was perfect, I like the sauce you cooked it in. How did you make it?
I caramelized mushrooms and then added the garlic to that and cooked it for a few minutes. Then added a bunch of parmesan and a little bit of cream. I seasoned with salt and freshly ground pepper.
It tasted amazing.
Here's your tea and some cake for dessert.
Thank you wow this coconut cake is fantastic. What's it made of?
It's made of flour sugar vanilla flavor eggs shredded coconut and coconut milk.
