Today I wake up at 8 am to prepare for an annual health check. 
Exam fees are sponsored by my company.
I left at 8:30 and arrived at the clinic at 9:30.
When I entered the clinic, the receptionist handed me a medical declaration 
so I could declare medical information and wash my hands with medical alcohol.
I finished the health examination at 11am and left for the company.
