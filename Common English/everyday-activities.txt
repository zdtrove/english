1. FIRST THING IN THE MORNING

- I get dressed, I make breakfast and eat it.
- Then I leave the apartment.

- For Special Attention:
    - 'wake up' = stop sleeping.
    - 'wake up' + 'get out of bed' = 'get up'.
    - 'take a shower' = wash yourself in a shower. You can also take a bath.
    - Other polite ways to say 'use the toilet' are 'go to the bathroom'.
    and 'use the bathroom'.

mouth and spit it into the sink.

my teeth and moving it back and forth and up and down.

    (← and →) many times.

- I put some deodorant under my arms.

- For Special Attention:
    - Use 'dry off' only if the water stays on top of the thing that
    is wet. You don't 'dry off' your hair or a towel. You 'dry' them 
    or 'dry them out'.
    - 'Pull something shut' = pull it until it is shut. Take some students 
    out of your classroom. The others (those still in the room) are 
    'the rest of' the class.
    - After you 'turn something on', it runs or works. After you 'turn it off',
    it stops.

    seem like 1 thing: 'a pair of pants'.

a skirt, some pants, some socks, some nylons (stockings), some pantyhose.

    - If it's hot, I wear light clothes: a short-sleeved cotton shirt and a 
    pair of cotton shorts.
    - I go barefoot indoor and wear sandals outdoors.
    - Dressing this way keeps I cool.

    and your feet near the 'foot of the bed'.
    - A 'pillow' goes inside a 'pillowcase'.

- For Special Attention:
    - A 'filter' has very small holes in it. A liquid or gas can pass through
    the holes, but large pieces of a solid cannot.
    - A 'strainer' does the same thing, but its holes are larger and it 
    probably has a handle.
    - If you grind coffee beans, you get 'ground coffee'.

    - You 'sprinkle' something by making small pieces of it fall 
    over a wide area.
    - Something that 'pops up' comes up very quickly.
    - When you make something go down, you 'lower' it; when you make
    something go up, you 'raise' it.
    - When you 'peel' a fruit or vegetable, you take off its skin.
    Afterwards, the skin that has been taken off is called 'a peel'
