*  [SECTION 1] STARTING THE DAY   *
* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *

1. FIRST THING IN THE MORNING

- My alarm clock rings and I wake up.
- I get out of bed.
- I go into the bathroom.
- After using the toilet and flushing it, I wash my hands.
- I brush my teeth, shave and take a shower.
- I dry myself off with a towel, then I brush my hair.
- I get dressed, I make breakfast and eat it.
- Then I leave the apartment.

- For Special Attention:
    - 'wake up' = stop sleeping.
    - 'wake up' + 'get out of bed' = 'get up' .
    - 'take a shower' = wash yourself in a shower. You can also take a bath.
    - Other polite ways to say 'use the toilet' are 'go to the bathroom' 
    and 'use the bathroom'.
    - When you 'flush a toilet', water cleans the toilet bowl.

2. BRUSHING YOUR TEETH - FLOSSING 

- I run some water over my toothbrush.
- I squeeze toothpaste onto my toothbrush.
- I move my toothbrush up and down and back and forth.
- To rinse my mouth, I take some water and swish it back and forth in my 
mouth and spit it into the sink.
- I rinse off my toothbrush, then I put it back in the toothbrush rack.
- I floss my teeth by pulling out a long piece of floss, slipping it between 
my teeth and moving it back and forth and up and down.

- For Special Attention:
    - You 'run water over' something by using water from a faucet or pipe and
    letting the water flow away after hitting the thing.
    - Something goes 'back and forth' by going from one side to another 
    (← and →) many times.
    - Something goes 'up and down' by going in these directions (↑ and ↓)
    many times.
    - You slip something some where by moving it gently into a small space.

3. TAKING A SHOWER 

- I pull the shower curtain shut. Then, by turning the knob, 
I turn the water on.
- I wash my hair with shampoo and the rest of my body with soap.
- Then I rinse off with water.
- After turning the water off I step out of the shower.
- I take a towel from the towel rack, then I dry myself off.
- I wrap a towel around myself and I dry my hair.
- I put some deodorant under my arms.

- For Special Attention:
    - Use 'dry off' only if the water stays on top of the thing that
    is wet. You don't 'dry off' your hair or a towel. You 'dry' them 
    or 'dry them out'.
    - 'Pull something shut' = pull it until it is shut. Take some students 
    out of your classroom. The others (those still in the room) are 
    'the rest of' the class.
    - After you 'turn something on', it runs or works. After you 'turn it off',
    it stops.
    - A 'deodorant' is something that takes away bad smells.

4. GETTING DRESSED - A MAN

I put on some underwear, a T-shirt, some socks, some pants and a shirt.

    - I button the shirt and the cuffs.
    - I straighten my collar.
    - I tuck my shirt into my pants.

- For Special Attention:
    - Usually 'a pair of' something means 2.
    - 'A pair of cats' means '2 cats'.
    - But some items of clothing are called 'a pair' even though they 
    seem like 1 thing: 'a pair of pants'.

5. GETTING DRESSED - A WOMAN

- My girlfriend puts on some panties, a bra, a dress, a blouse/a shirt, 
a skirt, some pants, some socks, some nylons (stockings), some pantyhose.
- After you put on your clothes, you wear them.
- Dressing for Hot Weather:
    - If it's hot, I wear light clothes: a short-sleeved cotton shirt and a 
    pair of cotton shorts.
    - I go barefoot indoor and wear sandals outdoors.
    - Dressing this way keeps I cool.
    - cotton: a fabric that comes from the cotton plant.
    - If something is outside a building, it is outdoors.
    - If something is inside a building, it is indoors.
- Dressing for Cold Weather:
    - If it's cold, I wears heavy clothes:
    - a long-sleeved shirt, a wool sweater, long pants and thick wool socks.
    - Before going outdoors, I put on a heavy coat and some gloves or mittens.
    - I wrap a scarf around my neck and put on a hat and some boots.

- For Special Attention:
    - Someone who 'goes barefoot' walks around with no shoes or socks on
    his/her feet. His/Her feet are bare.
    - If something 'keeps her cool', it helps her stay cool.
    - Some ways to talk about the weather:
        1. Use 'it + Be + an adjective: It's hot, It's hot outside.
        2. Use 'it + Be + the -ing form of a weather verb: It's raining, 
        It's snowing.

- I pull the top sheet tight, spread a blanket over the bed, and smooth it out.
- I spread a bedspread over the bed.
- I fluff up the pillows and lay them at the head of the bed.
- I pull the bedspread over the pillows and smooth it out.

- For Special Attention: 
    - To 'pull something tight' is to pull it until it is tight.
    - When you lie on a bed, you put your head near the 'head of the bed'
    and your feet near the 'foot of the bed'.
    - A 'pillow' goes inside a 'pillowcase'.
    - The corners of a 'fitted sheet' are make to fit over the corners 
    of a mattress. Fitted sheets are used only as bottom sheets, not as 
    top sheets.

    - I scoop some ground coffee into the filter.
    - Then I pour some water into the coffee maker.

    - The water heats up and drips through the ground coffee and into 
    the coffeepot.
- Making Tea:
    - I boil water in a teakettle.
    - I pour the hot water into a teapot and add some tea leaves.
    - As the tea leaves soak in the water, the water becomes tea.
    - I strain the tea.
    - Then I add sugar and milk, and stir my tea.

- For Special Attention:
    - A 'filter' has very small holes in it. A liquid or gas can pass through
    the holes, but large pieces of a solid cannot.
    - A 'strainer' does the same thing, but its holes are larger and it 
    probably has a handle.
    - If you grind coffee beans, you get 'ground coffee'.
    - 'scoop...coffee' = move it by using a scoop.
    - 'heats up' = becomes hot.
    - When something soaks, it stays in water and becomes very wet.

    - By pressing the starter I lower the bread into the toaster.
    - Hot wires inside the toaster toast the bread.
    - The toast pops up when it's done.
    - I spread some butter and jam on his toast.

- For Special Attention:
    - You 'sprinkle' something by making small pieces of it fall 
    over a wide area.
    - Something that 'pops up' comes up very quickly.
    - When you make something go down, you 'lower' it; when you make
    something go up, you 'raise' it.
    - When you 'peel' a fruit or vegetable, you take off its skin.
    Afterwards, the skin that has been taken off is called 'a peel'
    or 'peelings'.
    - 'Slices' of bread are also called 'pieces' of bread.
    - To 'slice' something is to cut it into thin, flat pieces.

- I put the egg on a plate.

- For Special Attention:
    - 'The egg fries' and 'I fry the egg' are both possible.
    - I have a 'gas' stove. Some people have electric stoves.
    - When you 'flip' something, you turn it upside down.
    - When you throw something 'into the garbage', you throw it into 
    a container for garbage.
    - To 'melt' something is to heat it until it changes from solid 
    to liquid.

- For Special Attention:
    - 'The paper' means 'the newspaper'.
    - 'A little bit' = some, but not very much.
    - First you 'sit down'; then you sit.
    - A 'mug' is a large cup with a handle.
    - My girlfriend and I sit 'at the table'. They sit 'in' or 'on' chairs.
    - You 'dip' a solid into a liquid by putting it in for only a short time.

    later, Goodbye.
    - 'Leave home' can mean the same as 'leave the house'. (For example, He 
    left home at seven o'clock this morning).
    - The opposite of 'zip up' is 'unzip'.
    - 'Shut' the door means 'close' the door.
