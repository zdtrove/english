Have you ever

===============================

Dialogue 1: Have you ever watched the sunset on the sea yet?

Do you have any plans for summer break
I'm going to california with my family
Wow sounds fun 
It's going to be a great experience
Indeed. There are so many interesting things you can do there
My mom said she's looking forward to seeing the sunset
That's right sunsets are beautiful
Have you ever watched the sunset on the sea yet
Yes but it was in miami
What was it like
The only thing I can say is that it was fascinating
The way everything slowly turned darker, the shadows of the palm trees and mountains on the various colors on the sky
Wow it must be magical scenery
We even drank beer and enjoyed some light snacks while we watched the scene it was an unforgettable memory
How did you feel about it 
It was my first time watching the sunset I felt really peaceful and happy like that moment was everything I need in life
Oh I understand that feeling
Yeah watching the sunset is definitely something you have to do at least once in your life 
I see well I'm about to be able to enjoy it
Make sure to take some pictures

===============================

Dialogue 2: Have you ever gone to a concert

Oh another artist canceled their concert again
Really 
Yes the announcement has just been posted
Because of the pandemic right 
Of course
Well that's so sad 
Have you ever gone to a concert I've never even gone there 
Yes I have I've gone to one last fall when I was in new york
Oh the bts concert right 
Yes
Did you have fun 
Obviously I did that's my favorite boy group 
They're very popular so it must be very crowded
Indeed the stadium was packed I remembered how hard I and my best friend had to try to get some tickets
But it was worth it right 
Yes the concert was beyond amazing
Do they sing well live 
Oh my god yes some songs were even better than the studio version
Cool seems like a perfect night
I've loved them since 2015. so yes I was so happy to see them
You sound like you missed that day a lot
I do the show was so good it was probably one of the happiest days of my life
A unique experience wasn't it 
True
Anyway I hope that the pandemic will end soon 
Yes I'm planning on going to another concert when everything goes back to normal

===============================

Dialogue 3: Have you ever received a present that you really hate

Have you ever received a present that you really hate
Actually yes 
When was it
It was last christmas 
Oh
When I opened the box I was speechless
Was it that bad 
Yeah inside it was a super ugly sweater
Sweater 
It wasn't even knitted properly the color was hideous red with brown stars all over it
Sounds really terrible 
The sadder thing was that it's from my mother
Unbelievable 
I didn't understand how she could give that sweater to me honestly but then I took it out and underneath it was a brand new pair of converse
So it was just a joke
Yeah but I have to say that it's truly creative

===============================

Dialogue 4: Have you ever loved someone 

Hey I've been talking to a very nice girl online
Really for how long 
Nearly two months but we're going to meet for the first time this weekend
Have you seen her face 
Yes we call on facetime a lot
Well that's good for you 
I think it's time I should start a relationship have you ever loved someone 
I have
Oh you look sad when I mentioned this do you want to talk about it 
Actually yes
You sure it's okay I don't want to make you feel bad
It's fine I need to talk to someone about this anyway
Alright how did you two meet 
In high school we were in history class together and we were partnered for a project
Oh a high school relationship is usually hard to forget
You're right 
What happened after the project
Well we just kind of clicked we had so much fun around each other
Who confessed their feelings first 
I did I asked her to go to prom and she said yes
Later I drove her home and we said goodbye on the porch I kissed her 
That's really sweet
And then we were officially a couple until the end of last year 
I'm really sorry
Yeah it was an amazing relationship but the long distance had been very difficult for both of us
I see does it seem like you still love her though
A little bit but the breakup was the best option

===============================

Dialogue 5: I have forgotten my boyfriend's birthday

I almost forgot my mom's birthday yesterday
Really 
Yes luckily my brother reminded me
Well I have forgotten my boyfriend's birthday once
Oh that's bad too how did everything go
Okay so do you remember when we were so busy for finals last year
Yes it was so stressful 
There was so much work so the day went by so quickly by the time I remembered that it was his birthday it was already past 12. 
How unfortunate
He seemed to be really mad at me he ignored me at school the following day 
So how did you fix that
Of course I threw him a late surprise party to make up for my mistake 
Nice
I apologized to him too I said that i was wrong and he's still an important person to me he was really moved after that he kissed me 
You two are really cute 
Thank you after that I had to remind myself to always check the date before rushing to work

===============================

Dialog 6: Have you ever been on tv

Have you ever been on tv guys 
No I haven't
I have 
Oh really when
When I was in 11th grade 
What show was that
I don't remember the name but it was about a conference for the youth that I joined
Cool 
So they interviewed you
Yes but it was a brief one 
What did they ask
Just a simple question like my thoughts about the conference and stuff like that
You're a good speaker I bet the answers were amazing
I guess you can say that. My parents were so surprised when they saw me
If I were them I would be surprised too
Well it was actually a nice experience

===============================

Dialogue 7: Have you ever had a makeover

Kitty have you ever had a makeover
Well yes why did you ask me that
I've been thinking of getting a nose job
A nose job at age 16
Yes and then I also need to change my style
I agree about changing your style but don't you think having a nose job now is a bit too soon 
So how did you makeover yourself
I learned makeup, dyed my hair, and went on a diet. Then I also changed my style 
That sounds like a lot of work 
It did take two or three years since I can't get an entirely new wardrobe after I lose weight
How are you feeling now after you've changed yourself
Of course I feel a lot more confident
Did that confidence change your life a lot
Definitely I socialized more take more photos and even went on a few dates
Dates 
Yes but I'm too busy to be in a relationship
Seems like a makeover can really change someone's life for the better
Still, I guess you should think again about getting a nose job. A makeover can only be good if you do it the right way
Thank you I'll think about it

===============================

Dialogue 8: You've never gone snowboarding

Mary do you want to go snowboarding with us on the school's winter trip
Sounds fun 
Yes we've been planning it for weeks
But I'm sorry I have to refuse
Why 
Well I've never done it before
You mean you've never gone snowboarding
Not really I tried it once but I was so scared that I couldn't do it properly
What a shame, it's an interesting activity
Why don't you try it again 
Yes we're going to be your instructors 
Is that okay
Of course you don't have to worry
So I guess I'll give it a try then

===============================

Dialogue 9: Have you ever gone camping before

Peter I need your help 
What's the matter
Have you ever gone camping before 
Yes i have
So what did you prepare for that trip
Not much I had no experience back then, so the trip was kind of a disaster
Ah 
But it's fine I learned some valuable lessons about being carefully prepared, so you can count on me 
Well okay then, what kind of problems did you have to face
First was insects they aren't harmless like those in the city so make sure to bring insect sprays and some medicine for the bites
Spray and medicine got it
Make sure to double check your tent before you go and make sure that it's not ripped
Right, tent, was it hard to set up?
Yes if this is your first time going, you can practice at home, though, there are tutorial videos online 
What about the weather
You have to check the forecast but also prepare for unexpected bad weather
Okay now I have a list of things here, check it out
Let's see okay seems like you've got everything
Great thank you peter
