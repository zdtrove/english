Camilla and Emily are two year old girls. They are chatting about their interests to plan for their winter holiday

Hi camilla are you all right
Yeah I am quite all right today how about you
I am so so I'm considering what I should do during the christmas holiday
Have you had any ideas yet
Not really but I probably would like to travel abroad
Which country do you like best
my dream is only to go to england I think it is such a beautiful country
Why do you like it 
Well I want to visit buckingham palace and have dinner on the thames river
I've been there once I especially recommend you to come to camden market
does it sell souvenirs 
No no it is a food market
What kind of food did they sell
Every kind it's amazing
Really I'm so excited to hear that
Yeah you know you can find a lot of asian food there caribbean food as well
Oh wow I always dreamed of having a food tour 
Yeah what is your favorite food 
I'm crazy about chinese food to be honest
I think there is a chinese restaurant near our school isn't there
No it is japanese I can only try it when I go to new york
That's why you must go to camden you can meet many chinese korean thaI and vietnamese and so on 
I will try to write it on my list is there anything you want to suggest to me
Have you heard about breakfast tea
Of course english tea I've seen it many times on social media
It would help if you tried that
It must be really delicious
Yeah you should have a cup of tea on the two-floor bus and go around london
Oh that sounds so romantic
That is my favorite thing to do every time I go to england
What about you camila what is your favorite thing to do during the holiday
Well I haven't planned it yet but I do like to go skiing
Wow I didn't think that you liked winter sports
I'm just fascinated by snow so I like everywhere that has a lot of snow or ice
What is your go-to place to go skiing
Last year my dad took me to france but actually my favorite country is always switzerland 
Man you've gone to europe so many times
It is because my family has business there
So do you like french or italian food
Well not really I am a big fan of fast food I mean it is unhealthy but I still like it
Wow are you hungry now
Yeah kind of 
What about going to burger king
Great idea emily


===============================

Harry and Emma have known each other for 10 years they met at high school but now they do not see each other often this is the first time they've seen each other after graduation
oh who do I see here are you emma 
yeah are you hairy 
exactly long time no see
has it been seven years since graduation
true I totally can't find you at all as you went to asia to study
yep I just moved back to england for a year
how was your life now 
it is so so I feel like you still like hip hop 
well I think I will forever so what is your favorite type of music
you know I like pop and especially korean songs right 
that's why you left me and went to korea emma
yeah and I think my taste hasn't changed but now I'm interested in country music
is that why you moved back 
no my friend I think when I get older I'll have different interests so I decided to go back home
what do you do now in london
you can guess 
are you a psychologist
why do you think so 
I remember you were really good at psychology when we were in high school
I took psychology as my major but after two years I realized that i prefer marketing
so you changed your major 
yes but it was a fantastic experience for me so then I just started working at a cosmetic brand as an advertisement analyst
that's cool finally you came back to england
hopefully it is a good decision so are you now a chemist
do I look like a chemist when I have a hip hop style like this
I guess not but perhaps now chemists change their uniforms 
after one year of graduation from university I dropped my job and became a photographer
really that's such a significant change harry
many people disagreed with me but i think it is the right choice
ah are you going to the football match this weekend in caulfield
emma do you also like football
yes why are you so surprised
because what I remember about you is a girl with a pink backpack that didn't like sports at all
I'm changing now my favorite color is
not pink anymore I prefer blue currently 
I like blue too it seems like we are still similar to each other after a long time
let's see what is your favorite movie
titanic you know that right
we watched it together harry and we were crying together as well
it is still the best movie for me now
that's true we should watch it again every winter 
do you like winter as well
yes what about you
of course we loved snowboarding
I still enjoy snowboarding did you change your favorite sport
never snowboarding is still the first thing that comes to my mind every winter 
we should go together one day
oh the sky is darker are you going to have dinner
I guess so 
uh what about going to have some beef steaks
do you remember my favorite food
it is not your favorite food it is ours
well my friend long time no see have some beef steaks and then try some cocktails later 
absolutely okay and are we going to the restaurant by bike
yes definitely
we still know each other's tastes emma
