Hey, good morning. How are you doing?

Good morning Joseph! It's only 7, why are you up so early?

Well, I was wondering if you would like to join me for a morning jog?

Morning jog? That's great idea. I've always wanted to improve my fitness.

Yeah, I know. I figured we could both jog together and it'd be more fun.

Absolutely! When are you going?

Right now! Get to the city park in 15 minutes and wear your jogging shoes.

Sure! See you there.

What are you making for breakfast?

How about a bowl of cereal?

Do you know that breakfast is the most important meal of the day?

I am sorry, but I am too busy to cook today, and you need to lose weight.

A bowl of cereals will be good for you.

Hmm... Okay, but please put in some milk and fruits.

Sure. It's going to be really healthy.

Yeah, but I love it when you cook an omelette.

I will make an omelette for you tomorrow dear.

Hey Joseph! Are you going to the office today?

Of course I am. I never skip work.

Could you drop me to the city center? 

I have an appointment there this morning.

Of course I can. It's right on the way.

Excellent. I will be ready in a minute.

Okay Maira, but please make sure you're ready fast. 

I don't want to be late for work.

Don't worry Joseph.

Hey Joseph. Tell me how you spend your mornings.

Well, I wake up around 7, brush my teeth and then I read the newspaper and drink coffee.

Hmm... Do you work out?

No. I usually don't exercise, but I think I should.

Yes. What time do you get ready for work?

I usually get ready around 8 AM. Then me and Maira have breakfast. We leave for work around 8.30.

Wow! You must have busy mornings.

Yes. Well, it's our daily routine. I am okay with it.
