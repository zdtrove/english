I do not want to go to class today.

Why not?

I do not like how the professor teaches.

What is wrong with it?

He only teaches lectures and never has a discussion, and he gives too much homework.

I do not mind him. I like his class.

I do not like biology. I am a English major so I am not that interested in science.

Where do you want to live when you build your house?

I would live in the suburbs of New York. I hate the city.

Why do you hate it?

The city is very crowded and noisy and there's no greenery. Just buildings.

I know what you mean. I love the greens too. I wish New York was less urbanized.

I think I will move to the countryside. I am very fond of trees.

I've had enough. I am quitting my job.

Why are you quitting?

I can't stand my boss any longer.

Why can't you stand him?

He puts too much pressure on me and I hate that.

He's a bad boss then.

He is. Everybody loathes him.

Well quit your job. You'll find a better one.

How is your sister doing?

She is doing well. She has a new boyfriend.

Oh wow. How do you like him?

I don't like him at all.

What is wrong with him?

He seems like a nice guy. I just do not like anyone dating my sister.

Ha! Makes sense.

I am quitting my job.

I do not like how the professor teaches.

She is doing well. She has a new boyfriend.

Where would you live when you build your house?

The city is very crowded and noisy and there's no greenery.
