Today is Tuesday, and it is also a special day for me.
This morning I started everything with a delicious breakfast from my mother.
She cooked me noodle with pork, egg, and vegetables.
I went to school with my best friend Jenny, and we just had enough time to talk about our favorite TV show last night.
I had a Math test today, so I was a little bit worried when the class started.
It turned out that I was able to do well on the test, and I felt so proud about myself for the rest of the day.
In the afternoon, I came to Jenny's house to have lunch with her because her parents rarely came home in the middle of the day.
We made a perfect meal from the ingredients that her mother had bought in the morning.
We took a quick nap before having some other classes at school.
We had a Physical Education class; today we learn how to have a badminton match.
Jenny and I were a team; and although our team failed totally, we had a great time playing outside with other friends.
I thought everything was just being ordinary as usual, but I had no idea there was a big surprise that was waiting for me at home.
When I first stepped into my house, I saw the entire family gathering around a box in the corner.
It turned out that my father had brought home a puppy, and it was the most beautiful creature to me.
After finished all of my homework, I ended the day with a cup of hot milk.
Now the puppy is sleeping right next to me, and I have to turn off the light so she can sleep peacefully.
Today is such a happy day.

==============================

I have been working like an officer for about 5 years, so my daily routines have many impacts from my work.
My work starts at 8 o'clock, so I wake up at 6 and a half to have a little time to prepare.
I take a quick shower, brush my teeth, and put on a little make - up.
Sometimes I cook some simple foods for breakfast, but sometimes I just choose to eat out.
I have many things to do at work, and my morning shift ends at 12 PM.
Whenever I make breakfast, I also leave some foods to eat in my break time; but sometimes when I am lazy, I just go out and eat at the nearby food stand with my colleagues.
We go back to work at 1 PM, and we try to finish our work of a day quickly so we are able to leave at 5 PM.
Sometimes when there are too many things for us to solve, my room has to stay over 7 PM to make sure everything is fine before we can go home.
After dinner, I usually stay at home to play with my phone or watching my favorite movies.
However, I sometimes do shopping or go to the coffee shops with my friends.
I spend about 2 to 3 hours to entertain myself before checking my mails and finish some of the necessary works.
I clean my house a little bit, and then I prepare everything for the next day such as clothes and documentary.
After having some simple snacks and a cup of hot milk, I brush my teeth and finally go to sleep at about 11 PM.
I spend most of my day for working, but I still enjoy life in my own way.
My day seems to be boring compare to others, but I am totally satisfied with it.

==============================

At each period of age I have a different habit, and now I have the habit of listening to English music every day.
This started when I was learning English at the age of 12, and my teacher encouraged us to listen to appropriate English songs to improve our listening skill and vocabulary.
At first I just listened to them as homework, but gradually I fell in love with the melodies and lyrics of the songs.
I listen to music in all of my spare time, and people easily find me wearing headphones everywhere.
I listen to many different types of music, and my list of music now is up to a few hundred songs.
In the morning I like to listen to Pop and Dance while preparing to go to school because they keep me awake and give me energy for the day.
At noon I listen to the gentle country music to relax, and classical music is the first choice at bedtime so I can fall asleep easily.
Some of my favorite singers are Adele, Selena Gomez, etc.
They also help me read more in English about international music news.
My sister is also learning another language, and I encourage her to develop a listening habit so that she can improve her listening skill and vocabulary.
Music is such a useful tool for entertaining, and I will maintain this daily routine as a way to both learn and relax.

==============================

Every morning, I wake up at 5:30.
After brushing my teeth and washing my face, I usually eat breakfast at 6:30 am.
I went to work by motorbike and was there around 7:15 am.
It took me about 15 minutes from home to go to school.
I usually start my work at 7:30 am.
I stopped at 11:45 am to have lunch at the school office.
In the afternoon, I finished my job at 5:30 pm, then I went home.
I always take the time to cook dinner for my small family and we usually have dinner at 7:30 pm.
After to dinner, we often watch TV and play with our son.
After that, I always prepared the lesson plan and went to bed at 11:00 pm.
On weekends, I often hang out with my family or friends.

==============================

Every night before going to bed, I usually have a habit of reading stories on the websites on phone together with drinking a glass of milk.
The sites I read are free reading sites for teenagers with many genres of books for readers to choose.
I often choose to read stories that have gentle or cheerful content which are not too stressful or complicated in order to help me fall asleep easily.
Actually this habit is very difficult to change, and not doing it means that my life style is also affected.
There was a day when I was too busy with the work; I did not have time to read the book because it was too late at night.
I needed to sleep immediately so that I am able to go to school on time.
However; I could not sleep because I did not read the stories as usual.
As a result, I slept two hours later than normal instead of spending 30 more minutes to read the stories.
From that day on, I tried to arrange my schedule to spend some time reading before bed because I did not want to lose my sleep again.
My mother often complains that I use the phone too much at night, and she is afraid that reading the phone might affect my eyes in a bad way.
I also know the harmful effects of reading on the screen, so I gradually changed to read books.
It turned out that reading books also helped me sleep well, and it also limited the negative effects on my eyes.
If the allocation in time is reasonable, my habit of reading something before bedtime is really not that bad.
Besides being able to read good stories, I also develop my own ability to write because reading really helps my vocabulary become much richer.
That is a good habit that I will continue to do before I go to bed, and I always hope it can brings me nice dreams.

==============================

I live an ordinary life, but I have something special habits in my daily routine.
I usually wake up at 6 o’clock in weekdays, and I always have breakfast at home.
A lot of my friends like to have breakfast at the school canteen to chat with each other, but prefer my mother’s delicious and nutritious dishes more than those processed foods at canteen.
After breakfast, I spend about ten minutes just to brush my teeth and make sure they are all clean since I do not want to replace them with implants once they are decayed.
My father is always the one who takes me to school because my mother does not trust my driving ability.
I have lunch break at 12 o’clock, and I choose to take the bus back home to have lunch with my mother instead of eating at the canteen with my friends.
All of my classes end at 5 o’clock, and my father always wait for me at our familiar spot to take me home.
Sometimes I go out with my best friends, but most of the time I just go home to watch my favorite TV shows.
I have a habit of watching TV while eating dinner, and I feel that the food is not as delicious as usual if my mother does not let me watch something on TV or my phone.
After finish all of my homework, I spend some time for my little hobbies.
What I love to do every night is reading books.
They are not some “serious” books that I like to read, I just like comics such as Doraemon, Conan, and Pokemon etc.
Whenever I do not have new books to read; I choose to play video games.
My father sometimes joins me in a dual match, and I am always the winner because he is not good at video games.
After spending half an hour in the shower and ten more minutes to clean my teeth, I go to sleep at about 10 o’clock.
Somebody might say I have a boring life, but I am happy and satisfied with it.

==============================

I find myself a pretty scientific lifestyle.
That is reflected in my eating habits.
I always try to make sure I eat well and still have enough nutrients.
One week I will spend at least 1 hour on the menu for my next week.
I usually eat breakfast at 6 o’clock to make sure I get to work on time.
My breakfast is usually bread and eggs with a glass of milk.
This is my favorite food. Lunch I will eat at the office.
My lunch will start at 12 o’clock.
My lunch is prepared by the kitchen.
There will be a savory dish, a light dish, with enough vegetables and meat along with a soup.
I love to eat vegetables.
Green vegetables help the human body metabolize better.
Eating plenty of green vegetables also helps the body become lighter.
My dinner is usually starch free.
I will eat light foods like salads.
The drinks in my meals are usually filtered water or juice.
I rarely drink carbonated water because it will make me gain weight very quickly.
That is not good at all.
You should choose for yourself a suitable diet to ensure your health and physique are always in balance.
