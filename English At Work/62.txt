Hello again and welcome back to English at Work – the drama about life at the plastic fruit production company called Tip Top Trading. You may remember Anna, the company's newest and brightest sales executive, was offered a promotion and a marriage proposal at the same time. She's taken time out to think about her reply but everyone in the office really misses her.

Tom
I dunno Denise, I'd be good for Anna, I think we would be been a perfect pair. Mr and Mrs Darcy… it sounds good…

Anna
I'm back!

Tom
Anna! I…we weren't expecting you.

Anna
Yes I can see – perhaps you could tidy up your desk Tom.

Tom
Very funny Anna – still trying to be the boss! So did you have a good trip? Did you get some 'head space'?

Anna
Eh?

Narrator
He means time alone to think about the things you want to think about. Tell him you've been chewing things over – it means you've been thinking about your proposals and say I have come to a final decision.

Anna
OK, well it's true; I have done a lot of thinking. Tom, I did have some head space and a chance to… chew things over…

Tom
Yes! Yes! And?

Anna
And I've come to a final decision.  The answer is 'yes'. I accept. There's no doubt really… I should give it a go… I need the experience… and besides, what's the worst thing that can happen?

Tom
Oh Anna. I'm so happy. You won't regret your decision.

Narrator
Hmm – is Anna really saying 'yes' to Tom's marriage proposal or has there been a misunderstanding?

Here are some of the phrases we've heard today:

I've had a chance to chew things over

I've come to a final decision

I'll give it a go

You won't regret your decision

Find out if we can look forward to Anna and Tom's wedding in the next episode of English at Work. Bye!
