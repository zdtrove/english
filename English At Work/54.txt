Welcome back to the chaotic offices of Tip Top Trading. Now Denise has left the company, the place is a mess and important phone messages are being lost.  What can be done to make things better?  I think we know the answer!

Paul
Hi. Did anyone take a message for me while I was out?  I'm expecting an important call.

Tom
Err… no!

Anna
Actually yes Paul. I wrote it on Tom's hand but he washed it off.

Tom
Look, good hygiene's very important to me.

Paul
Hmm. That's not very good is it? What's wrong with writing on a piece of paper?

Anna
We've run out of paper… and pens.

Tom
Everything really. Nobody's ordered any stationery or tidied up the office.

Anna
It's since Denise left.

Paul
Yes, maybe I was a bit hasty getting rid of her. It was really just to save money.

Tom
Yeah, but look, if we can't take messages from possible clients we're going to lose even more money.

Paul
Yes… I suppose you have a point. Maybe I will to have reinstate her.

Anna
You mean, get her back?

Narrator
Yes Anna, he does. Another way of saying reinstate is he's got to 'reverse his decision'. It means Paul has got to make an awkward call to Denise.

Tom
Look Paul, you're going to have to call her and tell her you've made an error… a huge one actually.

Paul
It wasn't that huge? Actually… Anna, you're her good friend, would you like to call her?

Anna
Me?! B-b-but I can't.

Narrator
What a coward! I think it's time to stand your ground Anna. Tell him "You're the boss, I think it's better coming from you", and remind him "it was your decision so you need to explain the situation", and remind him "this is your responsibility". You could suggest he says "I'm sorry, I made a mistake and we would love to have you back."

Anna
OK. Do you know what Paul, I think the news is better coming from you… just to make it official.

Tom
Yeah Paul, you are the boss after all.

Anna
And it was your decision in the first place so you need to explain that the situation has changed.

Paul
Well, maybe you're right but I can't tell her I'm wrong can I?

Anna
Look, just say you're sorry. Tell her you made a mistake and I would love to have you back… we all would.

PaulYes, you're right. I should do it. I'll just have a quick biscuit. Here goes.

Denise
Hello?

Paul
Ah... h-h-h-ello Denise. It's me… Paul…your boss… your ex-boss from Tip Top Trading.

Denise
Oh.

Paul
How are you… getting on?

Denise
Well…

Paul
Good, good. Actually, I've been rethinking our staffing situation in the office…

Denise
Yes?

Paul
And…well… I'm sorry Denise… I… miscalculated my staffing numbers.

Denise
You mean you made a mistake?

Paul
Well, I suppose so. So... I would love to have you back in the office as soon as possible. What do you say?

Denise
Hmm, let me think about it… hmmm… errr… well… hmmm…

Narrator
What will Denise decide? It was a hard phone call for Paul to make, but not one Anna should have made as it wasn't her mistake. She stood her ground with Paul and used the following phrases:

You're the boss and I think the news is better coming from you.

It was your decision in the first place so you need to explain that the situation has changed.

This is your responsibility.

Narrator
And here is a reminder of the phrases Paul used to try and apologise:

I've been rethinking our staffing situation in the office.

Sorry, I made a mistake. I miscalculated my staffing numbers.

I would love to have you back in the office.

Denise
Hmmm… well… OK then. I'll start back tomorrow.

Paul
Oh wonderful. I'm so pleased. We'll get your old chair back in position.

Denise
Actually Paul, if you want me back I'll need a new chair… and a new phone…

Paul
OK Denise! See you tomorrow.

Denise
And a pay rise!

Tom
So, is she coming back then?

Paul
Yes, first thing tomorrow.

Tom
That's good because we've just had a call from Nice'n'Cheesy – they said nobody returned their call yesterday and that if we don't contact them by the end of tomorrow they will go elsewhere for their plastic grapes.

Paul
Right, we must act… and act fast.

Narrator
Let's hope they don't lose that contract. At least with Denise returning to work, things will be a little more organised but for how long? Join us again next time on English at Work. Bye!
