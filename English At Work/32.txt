Welcome back to Tip Top Trading where things aren't going too well. Anna negotiated a deal with a client in France but now they claim they've been ripped off! This has got to get sorted – quickly.

Anna           
Oh Denise, what exactly did they say?

Denise     
Something about them agreeing a price for 5,000 lemons and then being offered a better price by another company.

Anna         
That'll be Tutti Fruity – they want our business.

Denise        
Sounds like they're going to get it, unless you sort it out. Maybe you should work out some new figures.

Anna            
Figures? Is there something wrong with my figure – am I too fat?

Denise         
No Anna! Your numbers – work out a new price, see if you can squeeze the price of lemons – maybe you can price Tutti Fruity out of the market.

Anna             
Hmm, somebody else has said that.

Narrator      
Yes it was me Anna! Do your calculations, see if you can offer a better deal and price Tutti Fruity out of the market.

Anna       
OK. I could sell them cheaper but there would be less profit.

Narrator     
Well, less profit is better than no profit. And who knows, if this goes well, it might lead to more contracts. But it's down to you now to make that call.

Anna        
But what am I going to say?

Narrator    
Be friendly and say… I'm sorry to hear you're not happy with our price. Tell them Tip Top Trading prides itself on quality products and good value for money. And flatter them and say they are a valued customer and their business is very important to us.

Anna       
And what shall I say about the price?

Narrator   
Tell them you can match the price of our competitors.

Anna      
Match the price. Right. Thanks. OK, I had better call them.

Trader        
Bonjour. Fruit Traders International.

Anna             
Oh, erm, hello, is that Monsieur Brown?

Trader      
Oui. Yes.

Anna             
This is Anna… from Tip Top Trading. I was sorry to receive your message.

Trader          
Yes, well. I thought we were doing good business and then another company called me and offered me a much better deal.

Anna             
Yes, I understand. I’m sorry to hear you're not happy with our price… but hopefully we can sort something out?

Trader          
Oh yes?

Anna             
You are a valued customer and your business is very important to us… and we would love to see our Imperial Lemons on display in the restaurants and shops of France.

Narrator      
That's a nice touch Anna, well done!

Trader          
So?

Anna             
So, I've done some calculations and we can offer you a better price.

Trader          
But Tutti Fruity can offer us a good price.

Anna             
I'm sure they can but… we… we…

Narrator      
Yes Anna?

Anna            
…at Tip Top Trading we pride ourselves on quality products and good value and I think we can match Tutti Fruity's price… in fact I know we can beat it.

Trader          
I see. That's good to hear but…

Anna            
We'll give you an extra 10% discount – but obviously we would like you to make a bigger order.

Trader          
Oh, a bigger order. I will have to have a think about this.

Anna             
Yes, of course, but please let me know as soon as you can before someone else snaps up this offer. Merci. Au revoir.

Trader     
Ah, merci, au revoir.

Narrator      
Excellent work Anna! I can see why she's got the job now. But will her sales tactics pay off? Let's remind ourselves of some of the great lines that Anna used in trying to resolve a tricky sales deal…

I'm sorry to hear you're not happy with our price.

Denise        
Well done Anna. It looks like you may have saved that deal.

Paul            
Saved the deal? Is there a problem?

Anna          
Well, Tutti Fruity has tried to undercut our price but I think I may have saved the deal we had with International Fruit Traders in France.

Denise        
Yes, Anna offered a lower price for a bigger order and they're having a think about it.

Paul            
Crumbs. If the deal's not complete I think you need to get out to France and seal the deal. I want you and Tom to fly out there as soon as possible and do some schmoozing.

Denise        
Oh! You and Tom hey?

Narrator     
That's enough Denise! This should be fun. Find out what happens next time on English at Work. Bye.
