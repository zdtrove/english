Narrator
Welcome back to English at Work. Paul, Anna and Tom are at an important International Plastics Conference. It’s been a busy day of networking but the big boss from America, Mr Socrates, has told Paul some bad news. Before he tells the team, there is an important award to be won – the Plastic Innovation of the Year award. Will Tip Top Trading win it?

I hope you've written your acceptance speech Anna.

Anna
Yes, I'm just doing it now.

Narrator
You've left it a bit late.

Anna
I've been so busy and now I'm really struggling. I don't know what to write.

Narrator
Well, don't forget to say "On behalf of everyone at Tip Top Trading, thank you for our award". Or, you could say "our company is at the forefront of plastic innovation". Tell the audience "this award is a real boost for everyone working at the company". Say that and you'll be fine.

Anna
…working at the company. Good, got it. Thanks. Oh hi Tom, how have you got on?

Tom
Great great. I've been hanging out with some of our clients – keeping them sweet, you know what I mean?

Anna
Err, I don't actually know. But I've had some success. Oh, here comes Paul.  Hi Paul.

Paul
Oh hello. Having a good day?

Anna
Yes, we're just talking about our success – let's hope we win that Plastic Innovation of the Year award, eh?

Paul
Oh yes... let's hope so. Although that means I've got to read out that speech you wrote for me. Public speaking is not really one of my things.

Host
Ladies and gentlemen, please take your seats for our special award ceremony.

Anna
OK, here's your speech Paul.

Tom
We've got to win first.

Anna
Shhh shhh. Listen!

Host
Thank you everyone for attending this year's conference. As you know, the highlight of the day is announcing the winner of our Plastic Innovation Award. So, without further ado, let's find out who this year's winner is. It is… Tip Top Trading for their Imperial Lemon.

Tom
Hey, that's us. We've actually won!

Paul
Oh crumbs. I suppose I'd better do my speech now.

Tom
Yeah… go on Paul you can do it!

Paul
OK, right. Whooah… ouch.

Anna
Oh no. Paul's tripped over that chair.

Host
Is there anyone from Tip Top Trading here?

Tom
Anna, you'll have to do the speech – you did write it after all.

Anna
What me?! I can't.

Tom
Go on. You'll be fine and besides I'm no good at public speaking.

Narrator
Yes you can do it Anna! Just start by saying 'ladies and gentlemen'.

Anna
Oh, if I have to. Erm… ladies and gentlemen. On behalf of everyone at Tip Top Trading, thank you for our award… our company is at the forefront of plastic innovation.

Tom
Yeah!

Anna
Erm… thanks Tom. This award is a real boost for everyone working at the company. We pride ourselves on innovation, quality and err… plastic fruit. And coming soon, we'll be launching a new plastic aubergine.

Paul
Ow, my big toe!

Anna
So thank you everyone, this really means a lot to us.

Tom
Brilliant Anna.

Paul
Yes splendid. Well done Anna.

Narrator
Well done indeed. Anna saved the day again by making that speech. She sounded confident and genuinely happy about getting the award. Here's a reminder of some of things she said:

Ladies and gentlemen, on behalf of everyone at Tip Top Trading, thank you for our award.

Our company is at the forefront of plastic innovation.

This award is a real boost for everyone working at the company.

This award really means a lot to us.

Anna
Are you OK now Paul?

Paul
Yes, sorry, that was rather unfortunate and a bit embarrassing too, but… hold on… what's happening now?

Host
Ladies and gentlemen, before you go, we have one more award to present.

Everyone
Oooh!

Host
We have a special award. 'Employee of the Year'. This recognises someone’s achievements and contribution to the plastics industry.

Tom
At last, I've been recognised.

Host
Please welcome Brad Socrates from Tip Top Trading International to award the prize.

Mr Socrates
Out the way. Where's the Goddamn envelope?  OK, right, and the award goes to… Anna from Tip Top Trading.

Anna
Me? Bbbut I…

Paul
Go on Anna. You deserve it. Go and make another speech!

Anna
Thank you everyone – this is amazing.

Mr Socrates
This girl is amazing. In just one year she has risen from an apprentice to a champion. It's great to have her on board. I think we should talk about your salary later hey?

Narrator
Can things get any better for Anna? I think they can. Join us again soon for more English at Work. Bye.
