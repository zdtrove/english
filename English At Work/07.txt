Ah hello! Welcome back to Tip Top Trading – the UK's leading wholesaler of imitation fruit. Today you're joining us in the middle of the action! Anna is with an important client Mr Lime, from Citrus Ventures. He's angry and she'll have to calm him down. She could cope brilliantly here or this could be a horrible mess!

Anna
Well Mr Lime, how can I help you?

Mr Lime
On Monday I was meant to receive 8,000 plastic grapefruit from Tip Top Trading.

Anna
Yes.

Mr Lime
The delivery was made on Tuesday.

Anna
Oh dear.

Mr Lime
And instead of 8,000 plastic grapefruit, I got 800,000 plastic pineapples!

Narrator
Right Anna, this is serious. You're going to have to apologise and show that you really mean it. Say: I'm really sorry to hear that.

Anna
I'm really sorry to hear that, Mr Lime.

Mr Lime
What on earth am I going to do with 800,000 plastic pineapples?

Narrator
Show Mr Lime that you understand the problem. These are phrases you can use: That's totally unacceptable. That must have been very inconvenient for you. And then promise to fix the problem. Say: You have my word that we will sort this out. We can do something to make up for the inconvenience. It won't happen again.

Mr Lime
800,000 plastic pineapples!

Anna
That's totally unacceptable.

Mr Lime
I didn't even have anywhere to put them - and pineapples are so much bigger than grapefruit!

Anna
It must have been very inconvenient for you.

Mr Lime
It certainly was! When he took my order, your colleague Tom told me that Tip Top Trading was the most reliable firm in the industry!

Anna
You have my word that we will sort this out. We'll remove the pineapples and have your grapefruit sent via express delivery this afternoon.

Mr Lime
Good. Thank you.

Anna
And we could include some of our latest-edition imitation oranges to make up for the inconvenience.

Mr Lime
Oh! Well, that would be nice!

Narrator
Tip top Anna! Excellent work and excellent words.

Anna
They're made with revolutionary premium faux-orange, laser-curve definition technology... you will be the first to have them!

Mr Lime
Wow, now that's good customer service! Tell me, do you have any other artificial fruits in this range?

Anna
Yes. Well, it's a bit of a secret, but you're a trusted client, so I think I can tell you...

Mr Lime
Go on...

Anna
We're about to unveil a new Imperial Lemon.

Mr Lime
Really?

Anna
I can't tell you any more for now. But…

Mr Lime
Yes...

Anna
Maybe we could present it to you more formally in a couple of weeks, when it's ready for release...?

Mr Lime
Sounds perfect.

Anna
You would be the first to see it!

Mr Lime
Excellent. Thank you, er... Anna, isn't it?

Anna
Yes.

Mr Lime
A very pretty name.

Anna
Thanks. It's spelled the same forwards and backwards. 

Mr Lime
Is it really?

Anna
Anyway, Mr Lime, we'll fix this grapefruit problem for you, and I promise you, it won't happen again.

Mr Lime
Good, good. You're new here, aren't you Anna?

Anna
Yes.

Mr Lime
Well I look forward to working with you.

Narrator
What a success! Mr Lime has come away a very happy customer! Here are the phrases Anna used while apologising:

I'm really sorry to hear that, Mr Lime.
That's totally unacceptable.
It must have been very inconvenient for you.
You have my word that we will sort this out.
And we could include some of our latest-edition imitation oranges to make up for the inconvenience.
I promise you, it won't happen again.
