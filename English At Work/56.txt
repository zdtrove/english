Narrator
Welcome back to English at Work. At the offices of Tip Top Trading, things are a bit… tricky. Denise has been reinstated at the company but now wants to do more than just ordering pens. Tom has other ideas and Anna is just caught in the middle. Who can she turn to? Paul maybe… or maybe not? 

Paul
So Denise, let's get this straight. You don't want to order the pens anymore, right?  

Denise
Well, I did say if I came back, I wanted to have a go at doing sales.

Paul
Err, yes, you did. That's right.

Tom
Yeah but we got Denise back because we didn't have anyone to order our pens and stuff. That's her main job.

Paul
Err yes, absolutely. I see your point.

Anna
Excuse me Paul, could I suggest we all take it in turns to order things like pens and paper… share the responsibility? 

Denise
That's a good idea Anna.

Tom
Yeah but…

Paul
No buts Tom, that's a good solution. Well done Anna… could you draw up a rota so we know who's going to be ordering the pens and when? And don't forget to order biscuits too! Phew, I'm glad I got that sorted out. Right, back to work everyone.

Tom
I can't believe I've got to order pens, it's Denise's responsibility… err, are you OK Anna?

Anna
No I'm not. I can't draw up a rota, not now. I've got too much to do.

Tom
Alright don't panic Anna. Just do what I do.

Anna
What's that?

Tom
Nothing! Just do what you can do and then pretend you've forgotten about the other stuff. Easy!

Narrator
Oh dear, Tom's not that professional is he? Not like you Anna. You just need to get organised and prioritise.

Anna
I need to prioritise?

Narrator
Yes. Decide what tasks need doing first and maybe delegate some tasks to others. You could say to people "I've got to prioritise. This is the most important so I'm going to concentrate on this first.", then you could say to someone "It would be a great help if you could take on this other task". You could also say "I'll have to put off some tasks until tomorrow". And if you still feel under pressure, say to your boss "I need help, I have too much to do".  

Anna
Thanks, good advice. I'm just writing a list of all the things I need to do on my new mini me-pad.

Narrator
Writing a list is a good place to start. Good luck!

Anna
There, that's my list finished. Ah, Denise, sorry to bother you, but you know that rota I was talking about?

Denise
The one for ordering pens?

Anna
That's it. Well, I'm so busy, I was wondering… it would be a great help… if you could make a start on this? Please?

Denise
Of course Anna. As it's you. If it was Tom asking, I would have said no!

Tom
What's that Denise? Hey Anna, what are we going to do about the designs for that plastic aubergine?

Anna
Gosh, our new aubergine. Hmm, I'm going to have to put that off until tomorrow I'm afraid.

Tom
Oh right. Why, have you got something more important for us to do together, eh?

Anna
No Tom. I've just got to prioritise. This new order from Nice'n'Cheesy is the most important, so I'm going to concentrate on that first. OK?

Tom
Oh right, yeah sure. Me and you will have to wait until tomorrow! So… so… how's it going with Dave from Computer Support?

Anna
Very well thanks Tom. Last night he took me somewhere I've never been to before.

Tom
Really. Nice.

Anna
Yes, a discount computer shop – he bought me a mini me-pad.

Tom
Oh. Just a 'mini' one hey.

Anna
Now, if you could take more interest in our Nice'n'Cheesy contract than you do in Dave, it would be a great help.

Tom
Oh yeah, sure, of course… nice'n'sleazy, that's a good name for Dave!

Narrator
Idiot! Getting organised is important when you have a lot to do. Tell people what you're doing and don't forget to ask for help. Here's a reminder of what Anna said:

I've got to prioritise. This task is the most important so I'm going to concentrate on this first.

It would be a great help if you could do this for me please.

I'm going to have to put that off until tomorrow I'm afraid.

Narrator
And don't forget, when you simply have too much to do, tell your boss!

Anna
Hello Paul, sorry to bother you. I'm a bit worried… I just have too much to do and need some help.

Paul
Yes of course. I don't want you feeling stressed. Let me think… erm... I know, why don't I do the pen rota?

Anna
It's OK, Denise has offered to do that.

Paul
Phew, I mean super! Erm… hmm… well, maybe Tom could help you with the launch party?

Anna
Launch party? What launch party?

Paul
Didn't Tom tell you?

Anna
No, he didn't.

Paul
We're launching the plastic aubergine on Friday.

Anna
Oh no!

Narrator
Keep calm Anna! We're here to help – although organising a launch party in a week is quite a challenge. Find out how it goes on the next English at Work. Bye!
