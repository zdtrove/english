Hello again. Things haven't been going well at Tip Top Trading. There was a fire in the warehouse, caused by Mr Ingle's cigarette and now Mr Socrates – the big boss from America – has turned up unexpectedly.

Mr S
So honey, are you…?

Anna
Anna. I'm Anna, I work here as a sales executive. We haven't met before.

Mr S
We sure ain't. Looks like I've arrived just in the nick of time.

Paul
(Out of breath)… what's going on… oh, Mr Socrates! Golly gosh, what an unexpected...

Mr S
Unexpected alright. Looks like this company is in a mess.

Paul
Err yes. It was OK when I popped out for some biscuits… erm, would you like one?

Mr S
Biscuits?! They're cookies man. Look, now what do I have to do to get a triple-shot, organic, skinny cappuccino round here?

Anna
I'll get you one Mr Socrates.

Mr S
It's OK honey. I need you to book me a hotel room. You... what's your name again…Paul… can you fetch me one?

Narrator
Right Anna. Booking a room for Mr Socrates. This is something you can't get wrong.

Anna
Well I've never done it before.

Narrator
I'm sure you'll be OK. When you book a room, here's what you could say:
Hello, I'd like to check availability and prices for a room please.
Does the price include breakfast?
Are there any business facilities such as internet and wi-fi?
I'd like to go ahead and make the reservation please.

Anna
OK I'll give it a try. But where shall I look?

Narrator
Try searching on the internet. Look for a five-star hotel. He is a five-star guest after all. Good luck.

Anna
Thanks. I better get back to the office and get started.

Tom
Hi Anna.

Anna
Oh hi Tom. Well done for saving Mr Ingle in that fire. You were very brave.

Tom
It was nothing really. So… err... what are you doing?

Anna
I've got to book a hotel for Mr Socrates.

Tom
No! You know, we must be in trouble. He never visits.

Anna
Really? So where shall I book him in to?

Tom
Well my friend runs a fantastic hotel – it's five star! It's called the Royal Imperial. Look, I've got his number. Give him a call, mention my name. You're bound to get a special rate.

Anna
Thanks Tom.

Tom
No problem. Oh but don't forget, I've heard Mr S only likes a room with a single bed in it. He gets spooked out if there's another empty bed.

Anna
Oh right. OK, I might as well give it a try.

Receptionist
Hello. Royal Imperial Hotel.

Anna
Oh, hello. I'd like to check availability and rates for a room.

Receptionist
When for?

Anna
For three nights from tonight. Your best room please!

Receptionist
All our rooms are the best! But… yes, we have one. It's £100 a night.

Anna
Right. I work with Tom…Tom Darcy… his friend runs the hotel. I wondered if you could offer me a special rate?

Receptionist
Tom Darcy? No I've never heard of him. Sorry, it's still £100.

Anna
Does the price include breakfast?

Receptionist
Yes. We offer a full continental breakfast of toast, or bread, oh, and tea…or coffee….and cereal.

Anna
Oh. And do you have any business facilities?

Receptionist
Well, we've got paper and pens.

Anna
I was thinking, internet, wi-fi… shoe-shine?

Receptionist
Yes. We've got that.

Anna
Good. And most importantly, is this a single room?

Receptionist
We've only got twin rooms.

Anna
Twins? You've only got room for twins?

Receptionist
No. We could take a bed out and just leave one in, if you want?

Anna
Oh that would be perfect. In that case, I'd like to go ahead and make a reservation please.

Receptionist
Good. How would you like to pay?

Narrator
Well done Anna for booking the hotel but I have a feeling Tom's recommendation may not be as luxurious as he says. Let's hear the phrases Anna used when booking a hotel:
Hello, I'd like to check availability and prices for a room please.
Does the price include breakfast?
Are there any business facilities such as internet and wi-fi?
I'd like to go ahead and make the reservation please.

So the room is booked. I wonder what Mr Socrates will think of it? He's a particularly fussy man as we'll find out next time. Bye!
