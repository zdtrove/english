Hello again and welcome back to the final English at Work. Mr Socrates has sacked Paul from his position as manager of Tip Top Trading and he's offered Anna a promotion – to be the new boss. But will she accept?  What's wrong Anna?

Anna
I feel bad about replacing Paul. He's been good to me.

Narrator
It's business Anna. He's just not up to the job – but you are.

Anna
Thanks. But why me? Can I do the job? I'm not as experienced as Tom.

Narrator
I think we have seen over the year that you definitely have more experience than Tom! Go on Anna, you can do it.

Anna
Hmmm.

Mr Socrates
So Anna… what do you say? Will you replace Paul as the new boss of Tip Top Trading? Come on Anna. This promotion recognises your achievements at the company. It's an opportunity of a lifetime.

Anna
I know.

Mr Socrates
You'll be my right-hand man.

Narrator
I think he means right-hand woman! It means you'd be his most trusted and invaluable assistant.

Anna
I see.

Narrator
Anna, if you need time to think you could say "thank you for your kind words" and, "could I have time to consider your offer?"

Anna
Erm, Mr Socrates. This news has come as a bit of a shock. Thank you for your kind words but please could I have some time to consider your offer?

Mr Socrates
Oh… OK Anna. But don't leave it too long. I have a habit of changing my mind.

Anna
OK, Mr Socrates… I mean Brad… I'll call you back soon.  Bye.

Tom
Oh… has Mr S offered you Paul's job by any chance?

Anna
Yes!

Tom
And you said you'd think about it?

Anna
Yes. I'm not sure if I can take on that much responsibility.

Tom
It's easy peasy. I could do it standing on my head.

Denise
But he's not offering­ you the job Tom.

Anna
Please don't mention this to Paul… not yet… he's very upset.

Tom
I know nothing!

Anna
You know nothing? About what?

Tom
I mean, I'll remain tight lipped… I won't say a word… until it's all official like. You can count on me.

Anna
"You can count on me"!?

Tom
Uh?

Anna
"You can count on me". That was the message with that that bunch of flowers someone sent me. It was you wasn't it?!

Tom
Well… err… I suppose… yes… it was me Anna. I couldn't help it. I… I… love you Anna.

Anna
Do you know what Tom… I quite like you too… I think you're… sweet. Now come on and give me a kiss.

Paul
Oh crumbs, shall I come back later?!

Tom
No it's ok Paul. We’re just… getting to know each other a bit better. In fact, Anna… I'd like to ask you something. 

Denise
Oh, why is Tom getting down on one knee?

Paul
I expect he's dropped one of his contact lenses.

Tom
No it's not that. Anna, I'd like to ask you something… err… will you… will you marry me?

Anna
What?!

Narrator
Crikey, what a dilemma. Now Anna's got two important questions to answer. Will she take the job as Tip Top Trading's newest and youngest manager? And will she marry Tom?  Here's a reminder of what Mr Socrates had to say about her:

This promotion recognises your achievements at the company. 

It's an opportunity of a lifetime.

You would be my right-hand man.

Narrator
And if Anna accepts the job, here's what she could say:

I'd be delighted to accept. Thank you.

When would I start?

Could we discuss the terms and conditions of the new job?

Narrator
Let's find out what Anna has to say.

Anna
Oh Tom, I don't know what to say. It's come as a bit of a shock. Can I have some time to think about it?

Tom
I suppose.

Paul
Well, while you think about that, I've got some good news. I've been offered a new job.

Denise
That's fantastic news Paul. What is it?

Paul
It's to be Head Taster at a company called Better Biscuits.

Anna
That's fantastic news Paul.

Tom
Yeah, well done Paul. That's right up your street.

Denise
So Anna, does that mean you'll do Paul’s job now?

Tom
Don't answer that. Answer my proposal first.

Denise
No, I think she should sort out her work first.

Tom
But I've been waiting to ask her for months.

Paul
I think it's up to Anna to say what she wants.

Anna
Quiet! Look everyone, I can't decide what to say to you Tom, or Mr Socrates. So I've decided I'm going to take a short holiday to have some time to think.

Tom
Good idea. Where shall we go?

Anna
On my own Tom. When I return I will give you my answers.

Paul
Crumbs. I think I'd better get a biscuit.

Narrator
A good idea Anna. But we’re going to have to wait a while to find out what she decides. She needs a rest after learning so much during her year at Tip Top Trading. We hope you've enjoyed learning with her and now feel more confident in using English at work! That’s all from me and the team at Tip Top Trading for now.  Until we meet again, bye!
