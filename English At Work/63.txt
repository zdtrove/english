Narrator
Welcome back to the offices of Tip Top Trading where there's a bit of confusion. Anna…

Anna
Yes?

Narrator
I think Tom's got the wrong end of the stick.

Anna
But I didn't give him a stick.

Narrator
No, no. I think there's been a misunderstanding. When you said your answer was 'yes' he thought you meant 'yes, I'll marry you'!

Anna
Oh no! I meant yes to the promotion. Gosh I've got to sort this out. Tom, Tom, hold on please.

Tom
We can't hang about Anna. Let's fix a date, invite everyone – even Paul.

Anna
No, no, we can't.

Tom
You're right, not Paul – he just talks about biscuits.

Anna
No. I mean 'no', we can't get married. I meant yes to the promotion. I can't marry you.

Tom
What? So when you said 'yes' you meant 'no'?

Anna
Yes.

Tom
I see. Right, that's it. Anna, I've made it very clear what I think about you and you… you… just throw it back in my face. I've had enough… enough of you… enough of this company. I quit!

Narrator
Anna. I think he's upset. He's having a tantrum.

Anna
A tantrum – is that serious?

Narrator
Not really. Maybe you need to calm him down and make him change his mind. Tell him 'not to be too hasty', 'don't rush into a decision' and say 'we can work this out' – you can can't you?

Anna
I think I can. Tom, please, don't be too hasty. Let's talk about this. We can work something out, just don't rush into making a decision – please. You're my best – my only – sales executive.

Tom
Sorry Anna – I'm a free spirit. I must go where the wind takes me. You've had your chance, now it’s mine. I’m off.

Narrator
Wow, I've never seen Tom be such a… man. Will this be the last time we ever see him?

 Here are some of the phrases Anna used to try and get Tom not to leave:

Don't be too hasty

Don't rush into making a decision

We can work this out

Tom
…erm, sorry, I just forgot to take my special mug. Bye.
