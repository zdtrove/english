Anna
(On the phone) Yes, we have plenty in stock. They're £4 per unit… They are good quality ones…

Narrator
The company in France that Anna called earlier has called her back. Let's hope they're making an order.

Anna
…laser technology isn't cheap… hmm, I see… Well, thanks for calling back. Bye.

Paul
Everything OK Anna?

Anna
Not really. One of the companies I cold called has rung back…

Paul
Good, good…

Anna
…but they don't want to place an order. They say we're too expensive.

Paul
So you let them go? Didn't you negotiate with them?

Anna
Oh, was I meant to? I wasn't sure what to say.

Tom
Having trouble Anna? Don't worry, I'm sure that I can help. Negotiating is my thing!

Narrator
"Negotiating is my thing"! What is he like? Mind you, he has won a Pear Salesman of the Year award so he must be doing something right.

Anna
Are you sure Tom? Don't you want to negotiate your own deals?

Tom
I owe you one Anna after you saved my bacon with Mr Socrates the other night. And besides you and me…

Paul
Come on you two. Get a move on. Europe is waiting for us! Custard cream anyone?

Tom
No thanks. Right. Now you need to call that French company back and ask them what kind of price they are willing to pay.

Anna
And then say that's fine?

Tom
No! Negotiate. Say "I don't think we can go that low".

Anna
"I don't think we can go that low".

Tom
If they want a bigger discount, tell them they will have to buy more stock.

Anna
More stock, bigger discount.

Tom
Yeah. And if you still can't agree a price, tell them "I'll meet you halfway".

Anna
Meet halfway?! That means going to Paris!

Tom
No. Halfway on the price. That line always works for me. I sold a load of plastic pears that way once.

Anna
So that's "I'll meet you halfway". Thanks Tom. I'm really impressed. You… you…

Tom
Am I, really?!

Anna
What? I was going to say, you really do know your stuff – despite what other people say.

Tom
What? Uh?

Anna
Right, I'm off to make that call right now.

Narrator
Good luck Anna and well done Tom! Nice to hear him give some useful advice but will it work? Let's remind ourselves of the phrases he suggested Anna uses when negotiating a sale:
What kind of price are you willing to pay?
I don't think we can go that low.
If you buy more stock, I can offer you a bigger discount.
I'll meet you halfway.

Narrator
Let's see how Anna has got on.

Anna
Success! They've agreed to buy 5,000 Imperial Lemons.

Tom
Brilliant. I knew you would be great. Did those killer lines of mine work?

Anna
Sort of – but when I said what price were they looking to pay, they said the full price! As long as I send them the contract today so I'd better go and get an envelope and post it as soon as I can.

Tom
Oh great.

Anna
Tom… Tom… can you come over here to the stationery cupboard and get an envelope from the top shelf for me?

Tom
Yeah, suppose so… I'm coming... (Door slams shut) …oh!

Anna
Oh Tom, why did you do that? It won't open… it's locked… help, help!

Tom
Help!

Narrator
Uh oh. This should be interesting. How are they going to explain being locked in the stationery cupboard? Until next time. Bye!

Tom
Let us out! We're stuck!
