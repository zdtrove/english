Anna
‘Look forward to hearing from you soon. Kind regards, Anna.’

Denise
(on the phone) ... And Margery said: 'I don't think I've ever seen a vegetable quite that size before...'

Paul
Where's that hole-punch?!

Narrator
Ah, business as usual in the offices of Tip Top Trading.

Tom
Oh for goodness sake! What a disaster! I can't believe it!

Narrator
But one member of the team seems bothered.

Tom
Arrgh!

Narrator
Anna, this is the moment to show you’re willing to help.

Anna
Yes!

Narrator
Use phrases like 'Is there anything I can do?' 'Let me help!' or, to be more informal, you can say, 'Can I give you a hand?' or 'Give me a shout if you need anything!'

Anna
Right.

Narrator
Go on!

Anna
Are you okay Tom?

Tom
(grumpily) No.

Anna
Is there anything I can do?

Tom
(grumpily) No.

Anna
Oh. What's wrong?

Tom
Everything.

Anna
I see. Can I give you a hand?

Tom
My computer has crashed. I've lost my phone. And there's a big, big problem with my timetable. I’ve got two meetings scheduled at the same
time with two extremely important clients. I can't do them both at once!

Anna
Let me help.

Tom
Thanks Anna, but these are big, big clients. They need someone of experience.

Anna
Well, give me a shout if you need anything!

Tom
I can handle this, alright?

Narrator
'I can handle this'... ungrateful idiot. But you used all the right phrases Anna, well done. Anyway, I bet he'll change his mind.

Denise
Oooh, I know, and the purple ones are so much more powerful...

Tom
Anna? Could you help me?

Narrator
Ha! I told you so!

Tom
They've both arrived at once! Oh god! I'll deal with Mrs Kumquat...

Anna
Okay.

Tom
You talk to Mr Lime, he's from a company called Citrus Ventures. They own hundreds of juice bars.

Denise
Are you sure that's a good idea Tom?

Tom
I don't have much choice, do I?

Denise
Well I could

Tom
Just keep him occupied Anna, tell him how great he is... no, no, tell him how great I am. Find out what he wants. If it's about the - well, never
mind, just be nice. 

Anna
Understood.

Tom
Mr Lime! Are you well?

Mr Lime
Yes, but I'm actually rather angry too.

Tom
Ah, well let me introduce you to Anna!

Anna
Mr Lime, it's a pleasure to meet you! Let me help with your coat.

Mr Lime
Oh er... Thank you.

Anna
Can I give you a hand with your scarf too, Mr Lime?

Mr Lime
Oh... Thanks.

Anna
Now, please come this way and you can tell me what's wrong.

Narrator
Well done! Anna used some good phrases to step in and help with this mess. Let's hear them again:

Is there anything I can do?
Let me help.
Can I give you a hand?
Give me a shout if you need anything.
But Mr Lime is obviously upset about something. What is it? And how will Anna deal with the problem? Let's hope it doesn't end in disaster!
