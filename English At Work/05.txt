Narrator
Welcome back to English at Work. We're still in Anna's first week in the busy offices of Tip Top Trading. How's it going Anna?

Anna
Everything's still so new to me. I keep needing to ask people for help!

Narrator
Well, that's only natural at the beginning. To ask people politely for help use the words would and could. You can also use the word please, but don't make the mistake of thinking's enough to make what you say polite.

Anna
Er, ok.

Paul
Hello Anna!

Anna
Oh hi, Paul!

Paul
I was wondering if you could do something for me?

Anna
Yes of course.

Paul
Would you be able to print out a file for me? It's a document on CBL – Convincing Bananas Limited – they're one of our suppliers. The file should
be on the system and could I have it in the next ten minutes please, as they're on their way here for a meeting?

Anna
Yes. Oh no, I've no idea how to find it! Tom...?!

Tom
Er, ask Denise. She should know.

Anna
Ok, thanks Tom, I'll ask her.

Denise
(on the phone to Sharon) I'd warned her, you know, I said 'Victoria, if you don't change your hairdresser

Anna
Denise?

Denise
One day you'll… hold on a moment. Anna?

Anna
Please email me the background file on CBL.

Denise
Er!

Anna
Thank you.

Denise
(on the phone) Who does that girl think she is?... Anna... new girl... I told you about her... yes with the saucepans, that's the one. She's only been
here five minutes and she's already acting like the Queen of Sheba... 

Anna
Oh and Denise, please send it to me within five minutes, Paul needs it soon. Thank you.

Denise
Really!

Tom
He he, good to see who's the boss, eh Denise?

Denise
Really!

Narrator
Er, Anna, I think you've upset Denise...?

Anna
Upset Denise?

Narrator
You were a bit rude when you asked her to help.

Anna
Was I?

Narrator
Remember what I said Anna. Just using ‘please’ to ask someone to do something can sound a little rude.

Anna
Oh.

Narrator
Instead of saying 'Please send me the file' you could say 'Could you possibly send me the file?' or 'Would you mind sending me the file?'

Anna
Oh! English is so confusing! I'll try to remember that. Oh no, the printer isn't even set up! Tom?

Tom
Yeah?

Anna
Please help me with…I mean, could you possibly help me with the printer?

Tom
Er... I need to finish this email to a really important new client.

Anna
But it's really urgent. Would you mind writing your email later?

Tom
Okay, since you asked so nicely. Let's have a look...

Narrator
Well, it's a good thing Anna has understood how to use 'could' and 'would' to ask for things, before she upsets anyone else. Let's hear those phrases
again:

Paul
I was wondering if you could do something for me?
Would you be able to print out a file for me?
Could I have it within ten minutes please?

Anna
Could you possibly help me with the printer?
Would you mind writing your email later?

Narrator
The printer seems to be working well, but how well are Anna and Denise working together? Are these two going to be enemies?

Denise
Really! 'Denise do this! Denise do that!' I'm telling you Sharon, I've almost had enough! I get treated like I'm some kind of servant!
