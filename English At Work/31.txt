Anna            
Help, help!

Tom              
Help us! We're locked in.

Narrator    
Oh dear. Do you remember that Tom and Anna are locked in the stationery cupboard? What are they going to do? And what will people say when they are discovered in there? I have a feeling we're about to find out…

Denise       
Goodness, what's that? Anna is that you? And is that you Tom?

Anna            
Yes, help! We're locked in.

Denise          
Don't panic, I've got the key. There. How on earth…

Tom               
…it's not how it looks Denise. We were just… erm…

Anna             
…just looking for envelopes.

Denise          
Really?!

Anna          
Yes, yes, really. The door slammed shut and locked from the inside when Tom walked in.

Tom               
Yeah, she's right. Just walked in, and shut the door and bang.

Denise          
Hmm. Let's just keep it our little secret shall we. (Aside to Anna) I thought you had better taste Anna!

Paul                       
Ah there you are Anna, I need a word with you… Oh, you look like you've been caught doing something you shouldn't! Ha ha.

Anna          
…but I haven't.

Paul         
Just joking Anna. Now could you step in to my office, we need to touch base about the European marketing strategy.

Anna          
Are we playing baseball?!

Narrator   
No Anna! Touch base. He wants to catch up with you, probably to see how you're getting on. Go on Anna, let's see what he has to say.

Anna        
Oh I see. That door doesn't lock does it?

Paul       
No, I don't think so. Right Anna. Biscuit? These new peanut ones are quite nice. So how are things with the project?

Anna       
Well, I've done some cold calling and have an order from a company in France.

Paul         
I see. Very impressive but have they signed on the dotted line yet?

Anna             
The dotted line?

Paul              
Have they actually signed the contract yet?

Anna             
Well, no, but…

Paul              
…that's the problem. There's a rival company who's also targeting the European market called Tutti Fruity - and they'll do anything to steal our customers.

Anna             
Oh I see.

Paul               
So, to keep our head above water, we need a clear strategy… and that's why I've put you in charge. So what shall we do?

Narrator      
I've a feeling Paul hasn't a clue – that's why he wants you to come up with the ideas.

Anna             
I think you're right – but I don't know what to say.

Narrator      
Tell him we need to price the rivals out of the market, that means offer the lowest prices so nobody wants to buy plastic fruit from our rivals. You could say that we need to corner the market, that means Tip Top Trading dominates the plastic fruit market.

Anna             
Oh, thanks. That's very useful.

Paul               
So Anna, any thoughts?

Anna             
Lots Paul. I think we've got to compete on price.

Paul               
Oh yes?

Anna             
We need to price Tutti Fruity out of the market. We need to corner the market so that everyone knows we are the best choice for good quality, good value plastic fruit.

Paul               
I like it!

Anna            
And… and…

Narrator     
Tell him we need to build good relationships with our customers – that means we give them good service.

Anna           
…we need to build good relationships with our customers. Talk to them regularly, send them gifts… go and meet them face to face.

Paul               
Face to face? Yes, great idea – just what I was thinking. If we follow this strategy I reckon there could be a bonus for us all by Christmas.

Narrator      
Well done Anna. Very convincing. If you can put your ideas into practice you'll save the company. Let's remind ourselves of the words you used to create the European marketing strategy…

We've got to compete on price.
We need to price the rivals out of the market.
We need to corner the market.
We need to build good relationships with our customers.

Narrator      
Well, things seem to be going well for Anna… or are they?

Denise          
Anna! Anna! That man from France has called again and left a message. He's not happy this time. Something about us trying to rip them off!

Anna            
What? Rip them off?

Denise          
It means over charging them or giving them poor quality goods.

Anna            
That's not fair. I'm going to have to sort this out.

Narrator      
That's it Anna – go and build a good relationship with your customer! Bye for now.
