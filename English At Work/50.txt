Denise
Morning everyone. How did you get on at the conference?

Tom
Oh hi Denise. Yeah it was… it was OK.

Anna
What do you mean 'OK'?  It was great. We made some new contacts and we won an award – Best Plastic Innovation of the Year, for our Imperial Lemon.

Denise
Oh that's wonderful. Wish I'd been there.

Tom
Maybe next year eh?

Narrator
Maybe?Welcome back to the offices of Tip Top Trading where everyone is catching up on yesterday's good news. But today it's bad news that everyone is going to hear following Paul’s chat with the big boss, Mr Socrates. But how bad is it? Let's find out.   

Paul
Morning everyone.

Anna
Hi Paul. Everything OK?

Paul
Yes, fine. Well done for winning Employee of the Year – I hope you can continue to be a great employee. Excuse me.

Denise
Hmm, he sounded odd. What did he mean?

Tom
Probably run out of biscuits!

Anna
He's obviously got something on his mind.

Paul
Denise, could I have a word with you in my office please?

Denise
Of course. I'll bring my notepad and pen shall I?

Tom
What's that all about? Anyway, now we're alone, I wanted to see what you're doing tonight… are you free?

Anna
Sorry Tom, I'm seeing Dave tonight. He's offered to fix something on my computer at home.

Tom
Oh, has he now?

Denise
All the years I've worked here – why me? Why now?

Anna
Denise, what's up?

Denise
Paul says he needs to move the furniture around and he has to let me go. He says he can't afford me anymore.

Anna
That's terrible… but where's he letting you go to? And what furniture is he moving?

Narrator
No Anna! If someone says they are 'moving the furniture' they really mean they are restructuring or changing the business. And if they say 'they have to let you go', it means they are sacking you or in other words, ending your job.

Anna
Sacking you? Oh, that is serious. Denise, I'm really sorry to hear this. But why does Paul want to 'move the furniture' around?

Denise
He says it's because of the tough economic situation. My role is no longer needed

Tom
Hey, that's not true. You make a great cup of tea Denise. I've got a good mind to smash Paul's bourbons into tiny crumbs. Grrr.

Anna
Calm down Tom. Now Denise, when did Paul say you had to go?

Denise
He's given me seven days' notice.

Narrator
A 'notice period' is an amount of time an employer must give an employee if they plan to terminate their employment.

Denise
I never thought I would be facing redundancy… not now… not at my age.

Anna
Redundancy?

Narrator
Yes, if someone says 'they are facing redundancy', it’s another way of saying they are losing their job. Hmm, I think Denise needs a shoulder to cry on.

Anna
Yes. Denise, do you want my shoulder to cry on?

Denise
Oh thanks.

Tom
Urgh! Erm… Denise, I've just made some tea would you like a cup?

Denise
Oh yes please.

Tom
Here you go. You know Denise, you've got to think positively. You'll get another job… and let's face it you didn't like working here anyway… you always looked so miserable.

Narrator
I don't think Tom's attempts to cheer Denise up are going to work! Losing your job can be a traumatic experience. It can come as a surprise and a shock. Let's hear the phrases Paul used to break the news to Denise:

We've got to move the furniture around.

I'm afraid I've got to let you go.

I'm giving you seven days' notice.

Narrator
And here are some other expressions you may hear in connection with losing your job:

Facing redundancy

Getting the sack

Terminating your employment

Leaving the company

Denise
Right, well, I might as well start clearing out my desk.

Tom
Yeah it's a real shame. Any chance I could have your stapler?

Anna
Tom, you could be a bit more sympathetic.

Tom
Oh right.

Paul
Tom, Anna. Could I have a word in my office please?

Tom
Oh no. This is it. It's my turn to get the chop!

Denise
Ha, You might not need my stapler after all!

Narrator
Crikey! Things aren't looking good at Tip Top Trading. Are Tom and Anna getting the chop… I mean, the sack?  Join us again next time on English at Work.
