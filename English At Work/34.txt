Anna           
Tom, could you let go of my hand?

Tom               
Sorry, it's just I get nervous flying.

Anna             
Well, we've landed in Marseille now so you're safe… oh, I like your passport photo.

Tom               
Oh do you?

Anna             
I didn't know your middle name was Stanley.

Tom               
After my great-great-grandfather.

Anna             
Really? Come on we need to get a taxi. Taxi! Taxi!

Narrator     
Hello again. Anna and Tom are on a very important business trip to try and sign a deal to sell their plastic fruit to a company in France. The company has received a better offer so Anna needs to convince them that Tip Top Trading's lemons are best. Are you feeling confident Anna?

Anna           
Not really. It was OK speaking to them on the phone but seeing them face-to-face is quite scary.

Narrator     
You'll be fine. Stay calm. They'll be pleased you've taken the time to fly out and see them – but tell them you're grateful for their time and recap what you told them on the phone.

Anna           
Oh yes – beat the price of the competitor but get them to make a bigger order.

Narrator     
Yes. If they order more you can offer a bigger discount. Good luck.

Tom            
Oh look, we're here now. Now Anna, I hope you don't mind me saying, but just leave the talking to me. Right?

Anna           
Err, well…

Tom            
Oh, Madame Brown, ciao, great to see you

Trader        
What?

Anna           
Monsieur Brown. Bonjour. I'm Anna from Tip Top Trading. This is my colleague Tom. Thank you for sparing the time to see us.

Trader        
No problem. Did you have a good flight?

Tom            
It was great. I love those little bottles of wine they give out… I kept a few with me if you fancy a glass of vin rouge?

Anna           
I think we should sit down and discuss business.

Trader        
Of course.

Tom            
Yeah, yeah, good idea.

Anna           
Now, I believe Tutti Fruity has offered you a good price but as I said on the phone, we can beat that.

Trader        
Yes you did.

Tom           
Did you Anna?!

Anna           
But to get this price you've got to buy lots more.

Narrator     
Anna! That's not very subtle. You need to convince them they need to buy more without telling them they have to.

Tom            
What she means is our Imperial Lemons are made with our unique laser curve technology. They are hard wearing and a joy to have on display in any shop window or restaurant.

Anna           
Tom, that's amazing!

Tom:           
I read it on the back of the box!

Anna           
So, we really feel that we have a product that you'll be proud to display. And to get this fantastic price you just need to place an order of 10,000.

Tom            
And we can even throw in a free sample of our new Perfect Peach range.

Anna           
Each lemon comes with a satisfaction guarantee. I know you won't be disappointed.

Trader        
Hmm. It sounds good. OK, I think you have a deal.

Narrator     
Good work Anna. Don't forget to ask him to sign the contract and tell him when he can expect the order to be delivered.

Anna           
OK. I would be grateful if you could just sign the contract. We'll get the lemons to you as quickly as we can. Tom, do you have a pen?

Tom            
Erm, no actually. It was in my bag yesterday but it's gone… it was a nice, a good one too.

Trader        
No problem. I have a pen. There you go.

Anna           
Thank you. It was a pleasure doing business with you. We'll get those lemons to you in two weeks' time.

Trader       
Perfect!

Narrator     
Good work Anna…oh and Tom too. The contract is signed but now you have to deliver what you've promised. There are many ways to clinch a deal; here are some of the phrases Anna used…

Thank you for sparing the time to see us.

So it's been a successful day. It's time for Tom and Anna to fly back to London and tell Paul the good news… or is it?

Anna           
Oh no look, our flight to London is cancelled! It's the last one today. What are we going to do?

Tom            
Well, I guess we're just going to have to stay here for the night. I'll sort out a hotel.

Narrator     
Until next time. Bye!
