Narrator
Hello! Welcome back to the offices of Tip Top Trading, where Anna's interview for a sales job continues. When we last said goodbye, Tip Top boss Paul had asked Anna why she wanted the job. First she said:

Anna
Errr... mmmmm...

Narrator
Since then, she's added:

Anna
Mmmm... errr...

Narrator
And as we join her again, Anna is saying:

Anna
Well, errrr... I'm errr.

Narrator
Come on, Anna! If you can't think of the word you need, find another way of saying it.

Anna
I am... Well, I really, really want this job and I am willing to work very hard if I get it.

Paul
So you’re very motivated, then?

Anna
Motivated! Yes, that’s it. I am really motivated.

Paul
Good! Why?

Narrator
Now over to you Anna; structure your answer! Say, 'firstly', then give your first reason, 'secondly' and then a second reason. Then say, 'above all' and give a really, really good, enthusiastic final reason! Go for it: firstly!

Anna
Firstly!

Paul
Firstly...?

Anna
Firstly, this job is an ideal match for my skills and experience: I've spent several years working in sales and I get on with people easily. Well, I mean, apart from the ones I don't like, of course. Secondly, I know Tip Top Trading is one of the fastest-growing companies in London, and I want to be part of that.

Paul
That's absolutely right. Tip Top Trading is the fastest-growing company in the plastic fruit sector. But enough about the company; this is all about you, Annabel.

Anna
Anna.

Paul
Sorry, Anna. Where were we?

Anna
Well, I said that firstly, this job is an ideal match for my skills and experience, secondly, the company is growing fast... and… and… above all… the reason I want this job is…

Paul
Yes? (knock on the door) Denise! Is everything alright?

Denise
No Paul, it’s not. Everything is not OK!

Paul
You look pale. Here, sit down, drink what's left of my tea.

Denise
Oh, thank you! Oh… what are those bits floating in it?

Paul
Oh they're just lumps of soggy biscuit. In fact, if I can just... get that bit out... with my finger... for you… Mmm, delicious! Now, tell me what happened.

Denise
Well, it's terrible...

Narrator
Oh dear! Just as Anna was doing really well, it looks like her interview has come to a sudden end. What’s happened? Join us next time to find out. But before we go, here's a reminder of how Anna structured her response:

Firstly, this job is an ideal match for my skills and experience
Secondly, I know Tip Top Trading is one of the fastest-growing companiesin London and…
above all… the reason I want this job is…
Anna couldn’t remember the word ‘motivated’, so she just found another way of saying what she meant.

I really, really want the job and I am willing to work very hard if I get it.
Nice work, Anna! Let's hope you get the chance to finish your interview next week!
