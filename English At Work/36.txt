Narrator
Welcome back to English at Work where Anna is very… well, very happy! You're in a good mood Anna.

Anna
Well, I'm just back from France, where everything went really well. It was quite an experience.

Narrator
Good. You got the contract for that big order. All you need to do now is to deliver what you’ve promised.

Anna
I know.

Denise
Hello Anna. Is Tom OK? He seems really grumpy since he got back from France.

Anna
He's fine. He just had to sleep on the sofa last night.

Denise
Really?! I'm sure that's not what he was planning. Now, did Paul mention he's got a new member of staff for you to meet this morning?

Anna
No.

Denise
Typical! Well, she's coming up in the lift with Paul now.

Anna 
Oh, so who is she?

Denise    
It's Rachel. Do you remember? She’s the woman who Mr Socrates recommended. He says she's brilliant and allegedly one of his best employees… oh, here she comes now.

Paul       
…and this is our office. Ah, Anna, there you are. Did I mention before you went to France, that Rachel is joining us for a while?

Anna  
No.

Paul
Ah… well… here she is. This is Rachel.

Rachel  
Hi!

Anna
Hi. I'm Anna. I work here as a sales executive.

Rachel
I know. You're quite new aren't you, ya?

Paul
Not that new. She's just won a great contract for us. Anyway, looks like you two are going to get on like a house on fire. Anna, I'd like you to, sort of, work alongside Rachel.

Rachel
Alongside? Shouldn't I be in charge?

Paul    
Yes… it's just, you know, you're not familiar with our office and Anna is, sort of, across this new contract… so… if you don’t mind?

Rachel 
OK. Just for now, but don't think I’m going to be told what to do.

Anna   
I'm sure you won't be Rachel but maybe we could help each other?

Rachel   
I'll try.

Anna         
Good! Oh dear. This is awkward. I've never worked with anyone like this before.

Narrator  
Well, now's your chance Anna. Rachel may be awkward to manage but try these phrases which may help things go more smoothly. Say, "I understand you have lots of experience so I would like to use your skills to help with the task." And, "Together we can do this job really well." But why not just start by making her a cup of tea. Good luck!

Anna        
Oh thanks. Rachel, would you like a cup of tea? And then we could talk about this contract.

Rachel    
I don't drink tea. Let's just get down to business.

Anna       
Oh, right.

Rachel    
Now, I think you need to check your stock and make sure you've got your oranges.

Anna       
Err… It's lemons actually.

Rachel
Whatever. Just get them and… you know… put them in a… thingy… a box.

Anna      
Well, actually… I understand you have lots of experience so maybe we could you use your skills for this task?

Rachel    
Well, it's true, I do have lots of experience. Thanks for recognising that.

Anna         
So maybe… we could work on this job… together?

Rachel     
Oh ya, sure. Great. Of course. I can get hold of these oranges… err… lemons, pronto. I know a man who can get some second-hand ones, it'll save us loads of money.

Anna      
But what about the quality?

Rachel
Quality?! It's the cost we've got to worry about. Keep up Hannah.

Anna   
Anna.

Narrator
Come on Anna. Don't let her boss you around. It's time to stand your ground. If she causes trouble say "let's discuss this so we can agree on a plan of action" or "please respect my decision and let’s move on."

Anna  
Hmm, OK, I'll give it a try. Rachel, I like your enthusiasm but… can we discuss this so we can agree on a plan of action?

Rachel
Of course. Why didn't you say? Come on discuss… discuss… talk!

Anna
Well, we pride ourselves on quality products and our Imperial Lemon is particularly good… and I think our client is expecting that. So I would like to send them what I had promised in the contract.

Rachel
Oh ya, I see. But I'm not really sure you're right.

Anna
Well, if you could just respect my decision this time and we can move on?

Rachel
Well, just this once Hannah. But I think I'm going to have to talk to Mr Socrates about you.

Narrator
Well done Anna for standing your ground. It can sometimes be tricky working with a new member of staff, but it's important to try and develop a good working relationship – remember business comes first! Let's hear those phrases again:

I understand you have lots of experience, so I would like to use your skills to help with the task.
Together we can do this job really well.
Let's discuss this so we can agree on a plan of action.
Please respect my decision and let's move on.

Tom
Hi Anna. Can't believe we were in France this time yesterday.

Rachel
Oh hello, Tommy boy. Long time no see! This is a nice surprise.

Tom   
Err… mmmm…

Anna           
Have you two met before?

Rachel   
We certainly have. Hey Tommy boy?

Tom          
Oh no!

Narrator   
Ha ha. Looks like Tom is lost for words – let's hope he finds them in time for the next episode of English at Work. Bye!
