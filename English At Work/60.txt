Hello again and welcome back to English at Work. Last time we heard the team from Tip Top Trading having a smashing time at the launch of its plastic aubergine. Tom threw one at Dave from the IT department, but it missed him and went through a window!  It's time for Paul to hand out some harsh words.

Paul
That behaviour just isn't on.

Tom
Sorry Paul… but it was quite funny wasn't it?

Paul
No it wasn't.

Anna
Sorry Paul, Tom was just angry with Dave. I thought he liked me but we saw him with Julie from accounts.

Paul
Really? He seemed such a decent chap… anyway, don't do it again. OK? In the meantime, you're going to have to pay for that broken window.

Tom
What… hey? Bbbut…

Paul
Now, excuse me, I need to take this. Hello, Paul Smith speaking. Ah, Mr Socrates… yes… ah, you've heard…

Tom
Crikey, come on we'd better go.

Denise
That was a good shot Tom! Looks like it's made an impact on Dave. Look, he's sent Anna some flowers.

Anna
Oh there's a note on it. It says "You can count on me" but no name.

Denise
That is a strange thing for him to write.

Anna
Hmm, it is and it's not his handwriting.

Tom
Maybe a secret admirer eh? I wonder who it could be?

Denise
Are you OK Paul? You look as white as a sheet.

Paul
I'm not actually. Mr Socrates says he's having a strategic review.

Anna
A what?

Narrator
He means he's been looking at how the business is operating and how it should operate in the future.

Anna
That sounds serious.

Paul
And as part of his review, he says he wants to downsize and he's asked me to… step aside.

Anna
Why? What are you in the way of?

Narrator
No Anna. To step aside is a polite way of saying to leave your position in the company.

Anna
Oh. I don't understand Paul. Why?

Paul
He says the company needs new direction and more dynamic leadership.

Tom
Crumbs Paul, you can't get more dynamic than you!

Anna
Tom! But Paul, you've been a great boss.

Paul
Thanks Anna. I guess it's the economic climate, we're not making enough money so cutting staff is inevitable.

Tom
Yeah but you cut Denise's job.

Paul
Yes but we had to get her back because she was necessary for the smooth running of the department.

Denise
That's right.

Paul
But Mr Socrates says I'm 'surplus to requirement'.

Anna
Oh, that doesn't sound good… does it?

Narrator
If Paul's job is 'surplus to requirement', it means his input to the business is no longer needed. So it's not good news.

Paul
Anyway Anna, Mr Socrates wants to know if you got his special message?

Anna
Special message? The flowers!?

Denise
That's strange. Why is Mr Socrates sending you flowers?

Narrator
It is a bit strange. Anyway, Paul's news has come as a shock for everyone. Here are some of the phrases Mr Socrates used to break the bad news:

I've been doing a strategic review of the company.

I need to downsize.

I need you to step aside.

The company needs a new direction and more dynamic leadership.

You are surplus to requirement.

Anna
Right, I'm going to have to call Mr Socrates and find out why he's sent me flowers.

Mr Socrates
Socrates… who wants me?

Anna
Erm… hello Mr Socrates… it's Anna here.

Mr Socrates
Anna! My favourite girl. Please call me Brad. So glad you called.

Anna
I needed to speak to you about the flowers you sent me. I'm very flattered but I don't think…

Mr Socrates
The flowers?! Sorry honey, I haven't sent you any flowers but I have sent you an email – have you read it yet?

Anna
No. What did it say?

Mr Socrates
I was saying that as I'm giving Paul the chop, would you like a promotion?

Anna
A promotion?

Mr Socrates
Yes. You have been an outstanding member of the team so how would you like to be the new manager of Tip Top Trading's London office?

Narrator
What a fantastic opportunity and one that Anna surely can't refuse – or can she? And who did send Anna those flowers with a message saying "You can count on me"? Find out what her answer is in the next English at Work. Bye.
