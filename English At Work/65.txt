Hello and welcome to English at Work where things have got rather dramatic.  Anna is on her way to the airport to try and catch Tom before he boards his flight to Australia and his new life on the other side of the world. But will she get there in time?

Anna
Thanks. Excuse me, do you know where the check in desks for flights to Sydney are?

Man
Yeah, over there luv – desk number 47.

Anna
OK, thanks.

Tom
… yeah, I always fly business class, it's the kind of guy I am… shame you're not available to fly with me but you know…

Anna
Tom, Tom!

Tom
Anna? How… what… what are you doing here?

Anna
Don't go… we need you… I need you.

Tom
But I don’t understand… you rejected me.

Anna
Yes but… but…

Narrator
But what Anna? What are you going to say? How can you tell him you were wrong and you've changed your mind?

Anna
Hmm, I don't know.

Passenger 1
Tell him 'I've been doing a lot of thinking'.

Passenger 2
Say, 'I didn't realise how much I missed you until you had gone'.

Passenger 3
And tell him, 'I've changed my mind, I will marry you!'

Tom
Yeah, yeah, I heard all that and that other man who you're always talking to.

Narrator
Oh right!

Anna
I see. Well Tom, will you marry me?

Tom
Why should I after all you've put me through?

Narrator
Yeah why should he?   

Anna
Because Tom… you're a funny guy and… I love you and… I can't live without you.

Passengers
Ahhh!  

Tom
Let me think about this … oh if you put it like that then yes, I will marry you!

Anna
Oh Tom!

Narrator
Hooray. At last! We got there in the end but not without using these phrases:

I've been doing a lot of thinking.

I didn't realise how much I missed you until you had gone.

I've changed my mind, I will marry you!

Narrator
And…

I love you and I can't live without you!

Tom
I won't be needing these anymore.
