Denise
Tom?

Tom
Here.

Denise
Anna?

Anna
Here Denise.

Denise
And Paul?

Paul
Yes, yes I'm here and there's no need to panic. That was just a fire drill – a practice.

Narrator
Phew, Tip Top Trading is safe – for now. It was just a fire drill. What a busy day this is turning out to be. Hey Anna, remember next time it could be for real so are you happy about what to say if you have to take charge?

Anna
Oh, not really.

Narrator
Just keep calm and say things like:
There's no need to panic.
Please leave the building and meet outside.
Use the stairs not the lift.
And when you're outside, you could say: Is anybody missing?

Anna
OK, thanks, but I hope I'll never need to use them.

Paul
Well done everyone. Hopefully you all know what to do in the unlikely event of a real fire. Now, to celebrate, I'm off to buy some really nice biscuits for all of us – you know, those special double-choc ones with the little orange bits. Back to work everyone.

Denise
Honestly! I was in the middle of an important call.

Tom
Yeah, and you never got see those firemen in action, did you Denise?

Anna
Look at the time. I really need to get on with my work.

Tom
Yeah, and I've got to check up on the latest football… I mean share prices. Hold on, can anyone smell smoke?

Denise
I don't believe it! The fire alarm's gone off again. I'll call you back Marge. Oh, where's Paul when you need him? Anna, you're going to have to take charge.

Anna
Me? What about Tom?

Denise
It looks like Tom has gone already.

Narrator
Remember Anna, use those phrases to keep everyone calm and informed about what to do.

Anna
OK. Err… there's no need to panic. Please leave the building and meet outside.

Denise
Hold on, I just need to grab my elephant dung notepad and red pen. Come on then Anna, into the lift.

Anna
No Denise. We must use the stairs not the lift.

Denise
Oh, with my knees!

Anna
Jump up Denise, I'll carry you.

Anna
Could I have your attention please.

Narrator
Louder Anna. This is urgent!

Anna
Could I have your attention please! I need your full attention. Please stay calm. I'm sure there's not a fire, just a bit of smoke. Is there anybody missing?

Denise
Well, there's no smoke without fire, hey Tom! Tom? Tom? Has anyone seen Tom? That's Tom coming out of the building and he's carrying someone on his shoulder!

Anna
It's Mr Ingle from the warehouse!

Tom
It's OK everyone… I've put the fire out… it was in the warehouse. Mr Ingle had been smoking.

Anna
Mr Ingle!

Mr Ingle
Err… yeah… sorry.

Narrator
Sorry indeed! Mr Ingle's in serious trouble now. But well done Anna for dealing with that emergency and getting everyone out of the building. Here are some of the phrases she used:
There's no need to panic.
Please leave the building and meet outside.
Use the stairs not the lift.
And when you're outside, you could say:
Is anybody missing?
Seems like Tom is a bit of a hero. He has his uses! But hold on, who's this?

Mr Socrates
Say Honey, looks like I've come at a good time. Have you seen a guy called Paul round here?

Anna
He's not here, he's gone to buy some… err… biscuits. Can I help?

Mr Socrates
Yeah sugar. I'm Mr Socrates, Paul's boss and I've come to sort this business out.

Tom & Denise
Mr Socrates!

Narrator
Oh no! The head of the company's in town. This means trouble. See you next time.
