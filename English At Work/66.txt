Hello and welcome to English at Work where the day has finally come – it's Anna and Tom's wedding. All their friends, work colleagues and business acquaintances are there… such as Mr Lime…

Mr Lime
Fantastic Anna, fantastic!

Tom
Yuk, Slimey Limey, I never liked him.  Sorry about the venue Anna – but it's all we could get at short notice.

Anna
I think the office at Tip Top Trading is an ideal place for a wedding and besides the…

Mr Socrates
Anna! My favourite girl.  I got here as fast I could. I thought I was the only man for you but I guess Tom has stolen that title! Your choice Anna, your choice!

Anna
Oh hello Mr Socrates, this is a nice surprise. Come over here and say hello to Tom.

Mr Socrates
Hey Tom.

Tom
Oh hello Mr S. Nice to see you. You're not doing any firing today are you?  

Mr Socrates
Of course not Tom. In fact, as a kind of wedding present, I wondered if you wanted a new job? I'm offering you a chance to manage my new office in Paris.

Tom
Me?! Manager… in Paris! Well Mr S…

Anna
Tom… aren't we about to get married… start a life together?

Tom
Oh yes.. erm, thanks Mr S for you kind offer but I will have to decline. I'm about to spend the rest of my life with this wonderful woman.

Registrar
Ladies and gentlemen, please could you take your seats. The marriage ceremony is about to begin. Do you Anna Jane Wijaya...

Mr Socrates
…out the way, give me that paper. Do you Anna Jane Wijaya take Tom Brian Farquhar Darcy … to be your lawfully wedded husband? To have and to hold from this day forward?

Anna
Ermm,  errr…

Narrator
Come on Anna. This is the most important phrase in the whole series!  It's 'I do'!  

Anna
Oh yes, of course… I do.

Mr Socrates
And do you, Tom Brian Farquhar Darcy…

Tom
…it's a deal… I do. Come on Anna, give us a kiss.

Anna
Oh Denise!

Narrator
Ahh. It looks like Tom has signed the best contract of his career but not without these phrases:

Thank you for your kind offer but I will have to decline

It's a deal

I do!

Anna
Thanks to everyone for making this a special day. If it wasn't for Tip Top Trading I wouldn't be starting a new life as Mrs Wijaya-Darcy.

Tom
Wijaya-Darcy? Shouldn't it just be Mrs Darcy?

Anna
I'm the boss now Tom at work… and at home!

Narrator
Congratulations to Anna and Tom. We have a happy ending – let's hope Anna's journey has inspired you to learn English at work.
