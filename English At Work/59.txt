Welcome back to English at Work. It's an exciting day for Tip Top Trading. It's launching its latest product – the plastic aubergine. The launch is taking place at a swanky hotel; lots of clients have turned up - but there's one important person missing.

Denise
Has anyone seen Anna?

Paul
I haven't seen her all morning. Tom, you were with her last.

Tom
That was last night at the pub. She was drowning her sorrows.

Denise
Drowning her sorrows?

Tom
Yeah. She saw Dave from IT with another woman – Julie from accounts, actually. She was very upset.

Denise
Oh poor Anna.

Paul
So you left her drowning in the pub? And who's got the prototype aubergine to show at the launch?

Tom
Oh no! Anna has. It's in her bag. What are we going to do?

Denise
Panic!

Paul
No Denise. Calm down. I'll just have to make a start and I'm sure Anna will turn up. OK, here goes. Excuse me everyone, could you all gather round? Our presentation is about to begin.

Tom
I'll change the slides for you on the computer Paul. I'm good with technology.

Paul
Okey dokey. Ermm…ladies and gentlemen, thank you for coming to our presentation. We have something very exciting to…ermm…show you and it's not a fruit…ha ha…

Anna
…and here it is – fresh from the factory – our plastic aubergine!

Narrator
Anna, you're just in time.

Anna
I know. I think I drank a bit too much last night and now I can't remember what to say.

Narrator
Well, you need to convince everyone that this is best product on the market and that it's something they really want. You could say "We believe this high quality product is something your business needs" – and, "Our new product has been designed to the highest specifications" – and tell people that "This product is the perfect decoration on any café or restaurant table" – tell them that, and the orders will come flying in!

Anna
What? They'll send them by aeroplane?

Narrator
No Anna! Just do your presentation and see what happens.

Anna
OK then. Yes everyone, this aubergine may look good enough to eat but it is made of the highest quality plastic and I'm convinced it's something your business needs.

Paul
Err yes, that's right. It may be plastic but it is… fantastic!

Anna
Thank you Paul. This product has been designed to the highest specifications. It's tough and durable.

Client
Yeah but why would I want to buy it?

Tom
'Cos it's cheap mate!

Anna
No Tom. It's because it is the perfect decoration on any café or restaurant table. It shows you're serious about food.

Paul
And it doesn't go mouldy.

Anna
Yes. We're taking orders today and… and…

Narrator
And? And what, Anna?

Anna
I don't know what to say next.

Narrator
Offer them a discount and a guarantee.

Anna
Oh right. If you place an order for more than 1,000, we can offer you a generous discount. Plus, all our products come with a money-back guarantee.

Client
I like it!

Narrator
Well done Anna. She gave a clear presentation, and sounded enthusiastic about the product. Here's a reminder of some of the things she said:

It is made of the highest quality plastic and I'm convinced it’s something your business needs.

This product has been designed to the highest specifications. It's tough and durable.

It is the perfect decoration on any café or restaurant table.

Anna
Thanks for listening. Tom has a few slides to show, which illustrate how the aubergine has been designed. Tom… Tom?

Tom
Oh no, it's frozen, the slides won't change.

Dave
It's OK, I can fix it, I am the IT guy after all.

Tom
Dave? What are you doing here? Cheating on Anna like that. Here Anna, give me that aubergine. 

Anna
Tom, no!

Tom
There, that's for upsetting Anna.

Dave
Ha ha - missed me!

Denise
Ha! Well the aubergine's certainly tough and durable.

Paul
Tom, Anna, I think we'd better talk about this back in my office.

Narrator
Crikey! That was certainly a spectacular presentation. Let's hope Tom’s outburst doesn't stop the orders flying in – but not via the window! Find out next time on English at Work. Bye!
