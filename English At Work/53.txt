Tom
Has anyone seen the stapler?

Anna
I can't find any pens.

Tom
Oh, here it is.

Paul
Will someone answer that phone?

Narrator
Hello again and welcome back to English at Work. The offices of Tip Top Trading have become chaotic since Denise left and just at a time when things are getting busy. How is everyone going to cope? Let's find out.

Tom
Hello. Yes? It is. We're very busy at the moment so call back later. Bye.

Anna
That was a bit rude Tom.

Tom
Well we're too busy to be nice.

Narrator
Hmm. Not a good attitude Tom. Even when you are busy at work it's important to be polite on the phone. It could be a potential customer. Anna, I think you're going to have to remind Tom about this.

Anna
Yes, I think so.

Narrator
If things are busy in the office you could say to someone on the phone 'we're a bit busy at the moment, could I take your name and number and we'll call you back'? And, 'when would be a convenient time to call you?' or if the caller wants to speak to someone specific you could say 'could I take a message please and I'll make sure he or she calls you back?'

Anna
That's useful. Oh there goes the phone again.

Paul
Anna, could you get that please? I've got a mouthful of biscuit. Thanks.

Anna
Sure Paul.  Hello? Tip Top Trading… yes, that's right… but things are a bit busy at the moment. Could I take your name and number and I'll call you back as soon as I can… oh hold on, has anyone got a pen?

Tom
I think we've run out. Denise usually orders them. Here, use my souvenir pen I bought in Italy, you see it changes colour if you hold it up to the light.

Anna
Thanks. Oh no! There's no paper to write it on.

Tom
Here, write it on my hand.

Anna
OK. Hold still. 7-4-9-0-5-6-8. Thanks for your patience, when is a good time to call you back? … OK… 3 o'clock… I'll call you then. Goodbye.

Tom
Sounds important.

Anna
Possibly. Oh not again!  Hello, Tip Top Trading, Anna speaking… I see… Well he doesn't seem to be here at the moment… can I take a message and I'll get him to call you back? Tom, I need your other hand to write on… keep still. OK, what's the message? … Yes, call Bob about the lemons on 8-0-9-5-2-4. OK, I'll pass that on. Thanks. Bye.

Tom
Goodness. It's been crazy here since Denise left. Look we've even run out of teabags. I'll go and get some, shall I?

Paul
Hold on Tom. Has that invoice for Tutti Fruity been sent out yet?

Tom
I dunno. Denise usually sends out the paperwork.

Anna
I wish Denise was here!

Narrator
So do we all!  It sounds like chaos in the office but however hectic things can get, remember to remain professional when answering the phone. Here's a reminder of some of the phrases you could use…

We're a bit busy at the moment; could I take your name and number and we'll call you back?

When would be a convenient time to call you?

Could I take a message please and I'll make sure he or she calls you back?

Anna
Ah there you are, Tom, you've been a long time. I need to give Paul that important message I wrote on your hand.

Tom
Ah… yes… it's a bit tricky. You see, I went to the toilet and then I… washed my hands.

Anna
Oh no, you've washed the messages off! What are we going to do now?

Tom
Erm… I'll get that, shall I?

Anna
We can't carry on like this.

Narrator
No you can't! Has Anna lost the numbers of two potential clients? Can the company carry on like this? It certainly looks like it could do with another pair of hands.  What will happen next? Join us again next time for English at Work. Bye!
