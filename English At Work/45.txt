Hello and welcome to English at Work. The company's computer system has been fixed and Anna seems to have found a new friend in Dave, the IT support man. But her main concern now is pitching her new idea for a plastic aubergine, to Paul the boss.

Tom
So Anna, that guy didn't really know what he was doing did he?

Anna
You mean Dave?

Tom
Dave – was that his name? He had a really bad smell.

Anna
No he didn't. He's done a great job. Look everything is working so, if you don't mind, I think we should get this pitch for Paul finished.

Denise
You'd better hurry up. Paul's taking the afternoon off to go to his biscuit lovers’ convention.

Tom
Oh right. Well, we might as well leave it until tomorrow then Anna.

Anna
No Tom. There’s no time like the present – I heard someone say that once – we've got to get our idea to Paul as soon as possible. Then we might have time for a drink, or shall I ask Dave?!

Tom
No, no, you're right. Look, I'll design some pictures of the aubergine and you get the results of our survey together, yeah?

Anna
Great.

Narrator
Well done Anna. Remember to make your pitch clear and exciting. Really sell it with words like 'exceptional!', 'fantastic!', 'quality', 'profit', 'efficiency', and 'value for money'.

Anna
OK, I've got all that. I'm just adding some of the facts and figures from our customer survey.

Tom
Anna, I've got the designs, they're coming off the printer now.

Paul
Denise, I’m off now. Can’t wait any longer for my garibaldis!

Anna
Wait Paul! I need to tell you about our new product idea.

Paul
Well, I, I, have to go. Can you tell me about it in the lift?

Anna
In the lift? Do I have to?

Paul
Sorry Anna, but that's the only time I’ve got.

Narrator
Right Anna. It's time for your 'elevator pitch' – an elevator is an American word for lift. You’ll need to pitch your idea quickly and concisely. You need to tell Paul what the product is and who your market is. Then talk about how you hope it will make money for the company. Talk about the evidence you have that it will be successful and convince him it will really benefit the business.

Anna
Phew, there's a lot to say in a short time but here goes.

Paul
Anna, could you just press the 0 button there, thanks.

Anna
Now Paul. Tom and I have come up with a new exciting product – the plastic aubergine.

Paul
Oh yes?

Anna
Yes. This fantastic product will be a great addition to table decorations in the café and restaurant market.

Paul
Will it now? Do you really think it will be a profitable addition to our plastic portfolio?

Anna
Oh yes. Using the same plastics as our fruits, we can easily re-mould our bananas and change the colour. We can increase efficiency but maintain quality.

Paul
And profits?

Anna
By my calculations, we can increase profits by 20%. That's based on selling the same quantity that we now sell of Imperial Lemons.

Paul
Hmm, 20%, really? But do you know who’s going to buy this product?

Anna
I do. We've conducted a survey and already found 10 new companies who would buy this and 27 existing customers who have shown an interest in it…

Anna
…and I'm confident this new product will be a huge success.

Paul
Very impressive. You've certainly done your homework. Look, let me chew it over – probably on a custard cream – and I'll get back to you.

Anna
Thanks. Paul, Paul… you've forgotten your bag.

Paul
Oh yes, I'll need that. Thanks.

Narrator
Great work Anna! You convinced me but have you convinced Paul?

So Anna's done her first 'elevator pitch' and kept to the facts. Here's a reminder of some of the things she said:

I'm confident this new product will be a huge success.

Tom
So, how did it go Anna?

Anna
I'm not sure. I told Paul as much as I could and I think he listened.

Tom
Good, good. So, what are you doing now?

Anna
I've got to meet someone.

Tom
Anyone I know?

Anna
No, not really.

Tom
It's Dave from IT isn't it? What does she see in him?

Narrator
Do you want me to answer that Tom?! Anna may have fallen for the charms of Dave but let's hope she keeps her mind on her plastic aubergines. Join us again next time on English at Work.
