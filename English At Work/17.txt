Welcome to the offices of Tip Top Trading...
(ongoing sound of annoying mobile phone ringtone)

Tom
Anna, are you going to answer that?

Anna
Er, well, no. It's stopped now anyway.

Narrator
...where Anna is behaving strangely.
(ringing starts again)

Denise
I gave you a long lesson on how to answer the phone and you're still too scared!

Anna
It's not that.
(desk phone starts ringing)

Tom
For goodness sake!

Denise
Then what?

Anna
I recognise the number - it's Mr Lime!

Tom
Ha! Old Slimy Limy, he must be absolutely desperate to get you to have lunch with him – even after your cruel rejection. Here, I'll answer for you.

Anna
No!

Denise
I'll answer. Hello, Tip Top Trading, Anna's phone... no, this is Denise speaking, Anna's busy at the moment. Can I take a message?... Yes... right.... I'll pass that on to her then… thank you for calling. Goodbye.

Anna
Well.

Denise
Nothing about lunch. He wants each Imperial Lemon you deliver to come in a luxury green box – like the one you had at the presentation.

Anna
My goodness, we don't have many in stock, I'll have to order some. Erm...(dials a number) Hello, this is Anna speaking from Tip Top Trading, I want some imperial lemon-sized luxury boxes.

Narrator
Woah, woah, woah.

Anna
What?

Narrator
Let's make this order a bit more politely okay?

Anna
Why are the English so obsessed with being polite!?

Narrator
Calm down Anna and listen to me. To put in an order for something, you need phrases like:
I'd like to place an order for...
We're going to need...
Could you send...
Could we also have...
When can we expect to receive them?

Anna
Right... Hello, sorry about that... I'd like to place an order for some imperial lemon-sized luxury boxes, please... we're going to need quite a few... could you send 300 please... yes... the green ones... could we also have the name of our company on the sides... when can we expect to receive them...okay, thank you, goodbye. There! How was that?

Narrator
Good, well done!

Denise
You'd better phone back Mr Lime to confirm he can have his boxes!

Anna
Oh no!

Denise
He's your client!

Tom
Yes Anna, he's your client!

Anna
I'm scared he'll try and ask about lunch again.

Denise
Then send him an email.

Anna
Good idea!

Denise
Copy in me, Tom and Paul, so it’s clear you only mean business only.

Anna
Yes. Thanks Denise! An email is much safer.

Narrator
Is it, Anna, is it? Hmmm...
Anyway, here are the phrases Anna used to place her order:

I'd like to place an order for...
We're going to need...
Could you send...
Could we also have...
When can we expect to receive them?
Let's see if Anna's email is really such a good idea. I have a bad feeling about it. Until next time!
