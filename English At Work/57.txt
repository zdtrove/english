Hello again and welcome to English at Work. The team at Tip Top Trading has lots to do, but now Anna has discovered she has to organise a launch party for the new plastic aubergine. It’s taking place at the end of the week and nobody has organised a venue yet! I think Anna is going to need some help.   

Paul
So Anna, I’m sorry Tom didn't tell you but do you think you can turn something round by Friday?

Anna
I'll try, but what do I need to do?

Paul
Oh not much, book a room somewhere, send out some invites… arrange some food… and drink… that sort of thing.

Anna
That's all?!

Paul
You can do it - you're great at this kind of thing. And get the team to help.

Anna
Well, I'll give it a go. See you later.

Paul
Thanks Anna. And don't forget to order some of those posh Belgian chocolate biscuits, they always go down well with the clients.

Narrator
Oh dear Anna. It looks like you have your work cut out.

Anna
Cut out?

Narrator
I mean, you have a difficult job to do - but as Paul says, you can do it.

Anna
Thanks.

Tom
Are you OK Anna? You look a bit worried.

Anna
I am. You forgot to tell me about the product launch on Friday and now Paul wants me to organise it.

Tom
Did I? Oh sorry. Look, if I can help in any way, just let me know.

Anna
Well, you could book a venue for the launch.

Tom
Ahh yeah… just remembered, I've got some Imperial Lemons I need to send out. Maybe later, yeah?

Anna
How am I going to find a venue for the launch at such short notice?

Narrator
You need to ask for recommendations, search on the internet, or look in the phone directory, and then make a call. You need to say "Could I check availability for your venue please?", then ask "What business facilities do you have?" and "How many people can the room or venue hold?" You could ask "Can you provide hospitality?" – that’s things like food and drink. Finally, don't forget to ask "How much does it cost?"

Anna
Thanks, there's a lot to ask. Hi Denise, I've got to book a venue for our plastic aubergine launch. Have you any ideas?

Denise
Well, my friend Marge works for a hotel company that has conference facilities. You could give her a call. Look, here's her number.

Anna
Oh, thanks Denise. Let's give it a try… 0–2–0–7–5–6–9–2.

Marge
Hello, the Pitz Hotel. Margery speaking.

Anna
Oh hi, this is Anna from Tip Top Trading, I'm a friend of Denise's.

Marge
Oh hi Anna. I've heard all about you. What are you ringing for?

Anna
I need to check availability for your venue for a product launch we’re doing.

Marge
Right! Well, I'm sure I can help. We do have a conference room. When is it for?

Anna
This Friday.

Marge
Friday! This Friday? Well… that's a bit tricky: the room is being decorated at the moment.

Anna
Oh.

Marge
But we do have a smaller room that you could use – it's got a lovely view of the car park.

Anna
I see… and how many people does it hold?

Marge
You could easily squeeze in about 20 people.

Anna
20 people. I guess it will have to do. Do you have any business facilities – somewhere to plug in the laptop, projector, wi-fi, that sort of thing?

Marge
Oh yes, yes, we're very hi-tech. We even have a fax machine!

Anna
And can you provide hospitality too?

Marge
Of course! We do a 'business platter' consisting of orange juice, sandwiches, canapés – that really means cheese and pineapple on sticks.

Anna
I wonder, can you also provide Belgian chocolate biscuits?

Marge
I'm sure we can.

Anna
That's great! OK… and most importantly, how much does it cost?

Marge
Well, to book the room for 2 hours usually costs £1,000. The hospitality is extra but as you're a friend of Denise, I'll throw it in for nothing.

Anna
You'll throw the food and drink in?! Won't that get messy?

Marge
No - I mean we'll provide it for free. Just don't tell anyone, otherwise everyone will expect it!

Anna
Well, that's fantastic Marge. Thanks. If you can send us an invoice, we'll sort payment out as soon as possible.

Marge
Bye Anna, and tell Denise I'll see her for our Zumba class tomorrow.

Narrator
Anna has saved the day again. The launch party for the plastic aubergine can now go ahead. If you're trying to book a venue for a business meeting or product launch, here are some of the phrases you could use:

Could I check availability for your venue please?

What business facilities do you have?

How many people can the room or venue hold?

Can you provide hospitality?

How much does it cost?      

Denise
So Anna, was Marge any help?

Anna
Yes. She found me a room and gave me a good deal. We just need to invite our clients now.

Denise
I can do that. I think it’s best if I call them - there's no time to post out invitations.

Anna
Good idea.

Denise
But I just need to give Marge a call first, just to check a few things.

Tom
Typical Denise. Nothing's more urgent than talking to Marge!

Narrator
He can talk! If you need something doing it seems like Anna is the woman you need. Find out what else she is capable of in the next episode of English at Work. Bye!
