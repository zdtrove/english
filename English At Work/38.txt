Narrator   
Hello and welcome again to English at Work, where things are a little tense. Anna is finding it hard to work with new employee, Rachel. She's told Paul, the boss, about Rachel's incompetence but he’s done nothing about it.  

So Anna, how are you feeling today?

Anna            
Frustrated. All that work I put in, getting the contract for Imperial Lemons and Rachel has sent out a load of second-hand plastic oranges!

Narrator     
I guess you're going to have to call your client and sort out the mess.

Anna            
I guess so. Oh hi Tom.

Tom         
Is she about? The man-eater?

Anna            
No it's all clear, she's gone out for a cappuccino.

Tom              
Good good. Look I managed to call the guy she bought the second-hand oranges from, and I cancelled the order.

Anna            
Phew, great!

Tom               
Yeah, yeah… and last night I managed to order some Imperial Lemons and sent them to that company in France – Fruit Traders International. Here’s the paperwork.

Anna             
Tom, that's brilliant! Here, let me give you a big hug – you saved the day!

Tom               
Ooh, that's a bit tight.

Denise         
Oh not again! You two just can't leave each other alone…

Anna          
Bbbut it was just…

Denise       
Say no more Anna. Now, I was looking for my special red pen, have you seen it anywhere?

Tom           
No. Funny that, my pens have gone missing too.

Denise        
I'll go and get some more.

Tom           
Now Anna, I don't want to interfere but have you called that company in France to see how they are?

Anna           
Well, they're fine aren’t they?

Denise       
It's good customer service to call them and see how they are.

Anna          
But what do I say?

Tom            
Tell you what. I'll go over there and you can call me and practise.

Anna           
Right. OK Tom, I'm calling your number now.

Tom           
Hello – Fruit Traders International.

Anna            
Yes, hello…

Tom              
…introduce yourself and ask me how I am.

Anna            
Oh right. Hello I'm Anna from Tip Top Trading. How are you today?

Tom              
I'm very well. Now ask me about the order.

Anna            
I hope you have received our Imperial Lemons and that you are happy with the order.

Tom              
Yes, very very happy. The lemons are… fantastique!

Anna             
Oh that's good. Erm… we do hope you are pleased with our service and that you may use us again.

Tom              
We certainly will. Thank you.

Anna             
Do you have any questions you may want to ask?

Tom               
No… actually yes…. err, can I… err… buy you dinner sometime?

Anna           
Very funny Tom. They won't ask that!

Tom              
No. I'm asking you.

Anna            
Oh right… erm… OK then… yes!

Narrator     
Hooray! Or should I say oh dear? Silly Anna has agreed to go on a dinner date with Tom – but there is still some business to attend to. Don't forget to make that call to your client Anna.

Anna             
No I won't – in fact I'll do it right now.

Narrator      
Good! While she makes that call, here is a reminder of some of the phrases she could use…

Hello I'm Anna from Tip Top Trading. How are you today?
I hope you have received our order and are happy with it.
We do hope you are pleased with our service and that you may use us again.
Do you have any questions you may want to ask?

Denise        
Are you OK Anna? You look a bit annoyed.

Anna            
I am – I just called our client in France to check everything was OK and they said Rachel had already called them and told them our lemons were so last season and they would be stupid not to choose oranges!

Denise         
That's terrible.

Tom            
…hey Anna, how about this restaurant for our date… I mean our business meeting. Look at this menu…

Anna           
Not now Tom. Rachel has messed things up again. She's causing so much trouble. She's got to go.

Tom            
Oh… yeah right. This calls for action.

Narrator     
It certainly does. It sounds like Rachel has gone too far this time and it's up to Anna to sort things out. But what can she do? Join us again next time on English at Work to find out. Bye!
