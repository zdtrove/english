Welcome back to English at Work, where Anna and Tom are in a bit of a predicament. Following a successful business meeting, they've returned to the airport to discover their flight has been cancelled. What are they going to do next?

Tom             
Right, they've rebooked us on to the next flight, which is at 7 o'clock tomorrow morning.

Anna           
Tomorrow morning?! What are we going to do until then?

Tom             
It's OK Anna, calm down. I've sorted out a hotel… quite a nice one actually.

Anna           
But what about our new contract? I've got to sort it out!

Tom        
Anna, take a deep breath… it'll be ok. Let's go and get a drink and we'll work things out.

Narrator    
Anna, maybe Tom's right for once. Go and enjoy some French hospitality. You've done really well today but perhaps you should keep your boss Paul in the picture.

Anna          
In the picture? I didn't take any photos.

Narrator  
No Anna! I mean keep him informed. It's always a good idea to keep the boss updated on what's going on – he is the boss after all.

Anna         
OK. I will.

Tom               
Yeah, this one looks quite cosy. I'll order us a beer shall I?

Anna             
I'd prefer an orange juice please.

Tom               
Oh really? OK then. Err, Garcon. Je m'appelle un beer et citron juice thing. Au revoir!

Anna            
What?! No Tom! Pardon, Je voudrais une grande biere et du juice d'orange s'il vous plait.

Waiter         
Oui Madame.

Tom           
I think she likes you! Well, everyone likes you Anna. I like you because…

Anna           
I like you too Tom but don't you think I should call Paul and update him on what's going on… keep him in the picture?

Tom             
I dunno. Let's just enjoy this moment shall we? And besides, he'll be at his biscuit appreciation class by now.

Anna          
No. I would be happier just to call him. Could I borrow your mobile phone please? My battery has run out.

Tom              
Yeah sure. You'll find his number under Attila the Hun.

Anna             
Attila the Hun?

Tom               
Just my little joke!

Anna             
Cheeky! But hold on… what am I going to say to him?

Narrator      
Well, don't call him Attila the Hun! Think before you call him: It's good news – you've closed the deal and the contract is signed. We need to proceed with the order as quickly as possible. And say, I'm committed to getting the order delivered on time. But if you need help, ask for it.

Anna             
OK I will. It's ringing…

Paul               
Hello?

Anna         
Hi Paul. It's Anna. I've got some good news!

Paul             
Hold on. Sorry, I'm just munching some new crumbly cream biscuits. Now, what's the good news? Is it about the contract?

Anna            
Yes! I've closed the deal with Fruit Traders International and the contract is signed.

Paul              
Excellent news.

Anna             
To keep them happy, we need to proceed with the order as quickly as possible.

Paul              
Of course, of course. So what are you planning to do?

Anna             
Well, obviously, I'm committed to getting the order delivered on time but I might need some help. I wonder if Tom could…

Paul               
Yes, Tom can help you. Denise tells me you have a… special chemistry! Actually, where is Tom now? Is he home yet?

Anna             
He's not. Actually Paul, Tom and I are going to stay in a hotel tonight… Hello? Hello? Oh, I've lost the signal, he's gone.

Tom               
Never mind Anna. I think he got the message. Another drink?

Narrator      
Let's hope Paul has got the right message about Anna and Tom! Anyway, she's briefed the boss and kept him in the picture. Here's a reminder of some of the phrases she used:

It's good news – I've closed the deal and the contract is signed.
We need to proceed with the order as quickly as possible.
I'm committed to getting the order delivered on time… but I will need some help.

Narrator     
A good day's work for Anna but now it's time for bed.

Tom            
Right, well, it's time for bed. We've got an early start tomorrow.

Anna           
So, where are we staying?

Tom            
A lovely little boutique hotel, just round the corner. I've booked a room with a view.

Anna           
A room? One room?!

Tom            
Err yeah. That's all they had, actually… honest!

Narrator     
Hmm. This could be interesting. Let's hope things remain professional.  Until next time. Bye!
