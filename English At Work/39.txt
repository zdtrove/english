Hello and welcome back to Tip Top Trading. New recruit Rachel has been making life difficult for Anna; she's been making some bad business decisions. Let's find out how Anna can save the day.

Tom              
Right, we've definitely got to do something about Rachel… definitely… only, I'm a bit busy at the moment.

Denise        
Sorting out your dinner date are you Tom?!  So Anna, have you spoken to Paul about this?

Anna            
Yes I have, but he didn't do anything.

Denise         
Hmm, well he is your boss so I think you've got to speak to him again. Take him some biscuits, that might get his attention.

Anna             
Well, I'll try

Denise         
Oh and keep notes so you have a record of your conversation.

Anna           
Denise, you're amazing. But where have the pens gone to?

Denise         
That is strange – we all seem to be losing our pens. Here, use this old pencil.

Anna            
Thanks.

Narrator     
Anna. Are you happy complaining officially about Rachel?

Anna             
Not really but what else can I do? She's been spoiling all the work I've been doing.

Narrator      
Yes she has. OK, well tell Paul the facts and tell him you want action.

Anna     
OK. Right, here goes. 

Paul        
Come in. 

Anna     
Hi Paul.  I really need to speak to you about Rachel. She really is messing things up…Paul?

Paul       
Sorry, just counting my biscuits. What were you saying? Rachel? Great girl, isn't she?

Anna      
No she's not.

Paul     
Oh.

Anna       
Paul, she's already sent out the wrong order and now she's upset our new client. Plus, have you seen the way she dresses? I'm not happy and I think you've got to take some action.

Narrator    
Anna, you're on fire! But stick to the facts, don't get personal about Rachel.

Paul             
Well I'm sure Mr Socrates would disagree with you. Look, if she is as bad as you say then I'll give you my permission to discipline her – give her a warning.

Anna            
What! Me?

Paul             
You know what's she done wrong so tell her not to do it again…and besides, I've got an important meeting to go to… and they usually have those delicious shortbread biscuits. So …I'll leave it with you then? 

Narrator     
What a useless boss!  Anna are you happy about what to do next?

Anna            
Not really. What am I going to say?

Narrator    
It's not easy but keep calm and professional and say to Rachel, "you've made some serious mistakes" and "you need to consult me before you contact any of our clients." Give her a verbal warning saying "These mistakes cannot happen again, otherwise I will have to refer the matter to someone higher." This may lead to disciplinary action but it may be for the best.

Anna             
Oh it's all very serious but I suppose I've got to do it.

Narrator     
Good luck!

Rachel         
Anna! Darling! What's wrong? I saw Paul and he said you're in a bit of a mood.

Anna            
It's not a mood Rachel. Can we talk please…now?

Rachel         
Yeah sure. Let's sit here, shall we – not in that chair – that's my favourite.

Anna             
Rachel, I wanted to let you know that you've made some serious mistakes.

Rachel         
Oh!

Anna             
You have really upset our new client – and you think it's ok to sell second hand plastic oranges.

Rachel         
Calm down. It's business, darling.

Anna            
It's not good business Rachel. These mistakes cannot happen again. If they do I will have to take matters higher and it could result in disciplinary action.

Rachel          
Oh! You're quite scary for a short girl.

Narrator      
That was unnecessary! But well done Anna for keeping cool and calm in a difficult situation. Let's hope Rachel has got the message. Here is a reminder of the phrases you could use when giving someone a verbal warning…

You've made some serious mistakes.
You need to consult me before you contact any of our clients.
These mistakes cannot happen again otherwise I will have to refer the matter to someone higher.

Narrator      
Let's find out how Rachel is behaving.

Tom               
Ah hello, Rachel.

Rachel         
Tommy boy. Come and give me a hug. Opps!

Tom               
Our pens! All our pens! You've been stealing them! Rachel!

Paul             
What's going on? I say, what are all those pens doing on the floor?

Denise          
They're from Rachel's handbag. She's been stealing them!

Paul               
What? The company's pens?Right, well, I need to see you in my office please Rachel, now…if you don't mind.

Anna/Tom/Denise 
Gasp!

Narrator     
So Rachel is the pen thief! What does this mean for her job at Tip Top Trading? Find out next time. Until then, bye!
