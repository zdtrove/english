Welcome back! This is what's happening today: as a result of some embarrassing mistakes in deliveries, Tip Top Trading's big boss in America has ordered a re-check of every order this month. So, Paul is talking to key customers to see if they've got what they needed:

Paul
I just want to check you're happy with the grapes?

Narrator
Tom, whom we all know was responsible for the disaster, is phoning his clients to make sure he has the correct information about what they want:

Tom
Ya, yah, I just want to make absolutely sure we get the order right for you and have the correct number of fruit...

Narrator
Denise is, well, talking on the phone to a friend.

Denise
Brown shoes don't look right on him! He's not a brown shoe sort of person...

Narrator
Anna has to go down to the warehouse, where the products are prepared for delivery.

Anna
I have to speak to Mr Ingle. Apparently he's not very friendly! He might not like me asking lots of questions!

Narrator
Well, be polite, and start your sentences with things like:
I just want to make sure that...
Could you possibly clarify...
I just want to check...
Just to be absolutely clear...
One thing I wasn't sure of was...

Good luck!

Anna
Mr Ingle, I don't think we've met yet, I'm Anna.

Ingle
Hello. Oi! What are you doing with those boxes? I told you to put them in storage. Anna, is it?

Anna
Yes, sorry to bother you, I just want to check something. We've had a few problems with orders….

Ingle
Well, that's not my fault. I do exactly what I'm asked to do. (To workers) No, not there, in storage!

Anna
Oh, well, I just want to make sure that….

Ingle
Thirty years I've been doing this job, and I've never made a mistake.

Anna
Of course, but because we've had problems, we need to make absolutely sure that all deliveries are correct.

Ingle
Humph.

Anna
Could you possibly clarify what went out in today's delivery to Mr Berry of, er, Bluetree Enterprises?

Ingle
500 redcurrants.

Anna
Right. That's fine.

Narrator
Well done Anna, this is going very well. Remember that other phrase – "I just want to check…"

Anna
OK. Now, I just want to check what was sent to Cocoline Limited – it should have been fifteen mangos...

Ingle
Yeah. That's right.

Anna
Great, and just to be absolutely clear, you sent the soft mangos, not the plastic ones?

Ingle
Yes, just like I was told to.

Anna
Good. One thing I wasn't sure of was whether we had enough yellow bananas in stock – I know there are some purple ones, but...

Ingle
Yeah well, we do need more yellow bananas.

Anna
Okay, I'll just write that down. Thank you Mr Ingle. By the way, I like your overalls!

Ingle
Oh thanks.

Narrator
Well he was a bit unfriendly, but Anna got what she needed. Here are the phrases she used:

I just want to make sure that...
Could you possibly clarify...
I just want to check...
Just to be absolutely clear...
One thing I wasn't sure of was... 
Well, everything in the warehouse seems to be okay. Back in the office, Tom is having less luck.

Tom
(on the phone) Really? Here it says 5,000 not five... oh...

Narrator
It's going to be a long day for him! Until next time. Bye!
