Hold tight please! 
This is Anna, on a bus going to an interview for a job as a sales executive at Tip Top Trading – one of London's fastest growing companies. 
How are you feeling Anna?

Anna
Oh, a little nervous but I really want this job.

Narrator
Well don't worry Anna, as long as you say the right things, you'll be fine.

Anna
The right things!? Like what?

Narrator
You need to sell yourself, be confident, not arrogant and give examples. 
Like: A good example that comes to mind. I'm particularly proud of. Timekeeping is important to me.

Anna
Oh right. Thanks. Perhaps you can come with me?

Narrator
Sorry Anna, you're on your own now – but we'll be listening in. Look! You've just arrived. Good luck!

Paul
Come in. Hello, I'm Paul, the Manager of Tip Top Trading. And you must be...?

Anna
It's Anna.

Paul
Yes, very good. Thanks for coming. Now somewhere in this pile, I've got your CV...

Anna
Err, is that it there?

Paul
Oh yes, thanks Hannah. Your qualifications look impressive but what sales experience can you bring to our company?

Anna
I worked in a shop once.

Narrator: Ohh Anna! Sell yourself. Give a good example!

Anna: Oh right...mmm...well a good example that comes to mind is when I was involved with a campaign to promote and sell a new range of clothes – I loved doing it and it was...

Denise: Oh sorry, excuse me, here's your tea Paul.

Paul: Thanks Denise. Now Anna, it looks like you've achieved a lot during your time at university. Could you give me an example of good team working during your time there?

Denise
Sorry! I forgot the sugar.

Paul
Thank you Denise.

Anna
Hmm, so you want an example? I was the treasurer of the debating society at university. That was OK I suppose.

Narrator
Come on Anna. Be more enthusiastic – the debating society is exciting!

Anna
I mean... I'm particularly proud of how I organized the finances for the debating society. We had a very small budget and I had to make decisions on what to buy.

Narrator
I like it! "I'm particularly proud of" - Positive but not boasting. You're doing well.

Paul
Very impressive – so you're a good planner Anna! We like organized people here... oops, silly me. I seemed to have spilt tea over your CV.

Anna
Oh, do you need some help?

Paul
Oh no...I'm sure it'll dry out... carry on please...

Anna
Also... timekeeping is important to me...

Narrator
"Timekeeping is important to me" – that's good!

Anna
I always try to complete my work on time. At university I never handed my assignments in late.

Paul
That's good to hear. We like punctuality here...

Denise
Excuse me Paul. Sorry it's a bit late – but I thought you might like a biscuit with your tea.

Paul
Hmm thanks...oh lovely, custard creams... mmm. Now Hannah, finally I wanted to ask you what exactly made you apply for this job at this company?

Anna
Err... ooo... well. The reason I applied is...

Narrator
Yes, yes, yes Anna? Do you need a bit more time to think?

Anna
Err...mmm...

Narrator
What's she going to say? How would you answer that? Join us next time to find out. Before we go, here's a reminder of some of the great lines Anna's used today... A good example that comes to mind I'm particularly proud of. Timekeeping is important to me. Until next time, bye bye! ·
