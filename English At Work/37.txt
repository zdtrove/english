Hello. It's another busy day at the offices of Tip Top Trading…

Denise       
And I said no John, not at my age, I'd rather take the bus…

Tom             
…yeah Pete, that's great, so we'll deliver 2,000 bananas by Friday. Let's have a beer soon… yeah… cheers mate.

Narrator      
But there are two people who are busy annoying each other…

Anna             
So you did what? You ordered the second-hand ones?!

Rachel          
Chillax Hannah…

Anna           
Anna!

Rachel         
…they're just oranges…

Anna            
…plastic lemons actually.

Narrator     
Anna is struggling to work with Rachel, Mr Socrates' favourite Sales Executive, who he's sent in to help out… or hinder more like!

Rachel         
Look, I'm off for a cappuccino, everything will be just fine. Ciao.

Tom               
Anna, has Rachel gone out?

Anna             
Yes.

Tom               
She's a bit of a man-eater. She almost ate me once.

Anna             
She eats men?

Tom               
Well, not exactly. I worked with her in my last job. She was always listening in to other people's conversations and she's always changing jobs. That's why they call her Rachel Rabbit – you know, big ears, always jumping from one job to another.

Anna             
Rachel Rabbit! That's funny. So she isn't that good then?

Tom               
Oh, useless! She only worked for Mr Socrates because her father threatened to sue the company, after one of our plastic pineapples fell off a shelf and broke his toe. But, better keep that under your hat.

Anna             
My hat?

Tom               
I mean, keep it secret.

Anna             
Oh right, I see. Well, now she's ordered loads of second-hand oranges to send to our new customer in France.

Tom               
But they wanted Imperial Lemons?

Anna             
I know. I'm not sure what to do, so I'm going to have to speak to Paul about this.

Narrator     
Yes it's a good idea to refer up sometimes – ask the boss for advice. Say to him "I'm concerned that Rachel has made a mistake that might affect the business". You might also say "she's not pulling her weight", meaning she's not doing the work she is supposed to do. And you could say "I'm finding it very difficult to work with this person."

Anna             
Right. I'll try. There's Paul now… Paul, could I have a word please?

Paul               
Of course, Anna. Let's go in my office. Now, how can I help?

Anna             
Err, well, it's Rachel.

Paul              
Yes, amazing woman. Mr Socrates' favourite.

Anna             
I know… but I'm finding it difficult to work with her.

Paul              
Oh why's that?

Anna             
I'm a bit concerned that she's made a mistake and it might affect our business.

Paul               
Golly gosh. Really?! Why's that?

Anna             
Well, she's ordered second-hand oranges for our new client in France.

Paul               
That's marvellous… isn't it?

Anna             
Well, I asked her not to. They wanted lemons… new Imperial Lemons.

Paul               
Ah… not so marvellous. Anything else?

Anna             
Well, speaking personally, I don't think she's pulling her weight. She doesn't seem to do any work and just keeps going out to buy cappuccinos.

Paul               
Well, that's just not on. Look Anna, I will look into this straight away and see if I can sort this out. Thank you for bringing it to my attention. Now, I think you've earned a custard cream.

Narrator      
So Anna has expressed her concerns to Paul, the boss. It's up to him to investigate. As long as you have a fair reason to complain about a difficult member of staff, these are some of the phrases you could use: 

I'm concerned that she's made a mistake that might affect the business.
She's not pulling her weight.
I'm finding it very difficult to work with her.

I wonder how Paul is going to handle the situation?

Paul            
Ah, there you are Rachel. Nice cappuccino? Could you step in to my office for a moment… I'd like a word.

Rachel        
Ya, sure. 

Denise      
Ooh, I wonder what that's all about. Do you know Anna?

Anna          
Hmm, no idea.

Tom           
She's probably going to get a promotion and a pay rise… and a custard cream!

Rachel        
Thanks Paul, ciao. What a great guy he is. Such a great sense of humour! Looks like we're doing some good work Anna!

Anna           
Wwwhat?!

Narrator     
Oh Anna. I'm not sure Paul has really sorted out your concerns. But don't worry, we're here to help you out. See you next time on English at Work. Bye!
