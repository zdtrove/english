Narrator
Welcome back. Things are quite tense at Tip Top Trading today. Paul, the boss, mistakenly thinks Anna's been smoking on company premises and she's trying to explain herself.

Anna
But, but…

Paul
Frankly, I'm disappointed with you Anna. You're a hard worker but it doesn't mean you can go against company policy.

Narrator
Anna, remember the phrases we've learnt about a misunderstanding!

Anna
Oh yes. Paul, I think there's been a misunderstanding.

Paul
A misunderstanding? How can you explain the smell of cigarette smoke? This is a 'no smoking' building.

Anna
Let me explain. I went down to the warehouse to speak to Mr Ingle and… well… someone else was smoking.

Paul
What!? Someone was smoking in the warehouse? Golly gosh, that's highly dangerous. Who was it Anna?

Anna
Err… well… I can't really say. But I dealt with it and it won't happen again.

Narrator
Yes, you dealt with it very well Anna but can you keep your secret about Mr Ingle safe?

Paul
Thank you Anna and sorry about the misunderstanding. Would you like a biscuit? Now I really think it's time we had a review of our health and safety procedures.

Paul
Denise, could you gather everyone round in the meeting room please.

Denise
(On phone) I'll have to call you back Marge. (Hangs up) Could you all gather in the meeting room please, Paul has something important to say.

Tom
What is it Denise? Is it about my fantastic sales figures again, huh?

Denise
I doubt it Tom. It sounded urgent. I'd better bring some tea.

Paul
Thank you for joining me. Unfortunately, there has been an incident in the warehouse. Someone has been smoking and I'm not happy, so I thought I would remind you of our health and safety procedures.

Tom
Not this again!

Paul
Your safety is our responsibility. But to keep safe we must follow some simple rules. Denise, what's the first one?

Denise
(Slurps tea) If you see a fire, raise the alarm – oh and call the fire service.

Tom
Yeah, you love seeing those firemen, don't you, Denise!

Paul
Shhh Tom. Maybe you could tell us the other rule?

Tom
Oh yeah right. If you hear the fire alarm, get out quick.

Paul
Not exactly Tom. I think we should walk calmly to our nearest fire exit, following the green signs, go outside and meet at the fire assembly point.

Denise
Yes, and I will take a register of who is here, using my red pen (slurps tea).

Paul
Do you mind not slurping Denise?

Denise
This is thirsty work.

Paul
Hmm. Now is everyone clear about what to do if there is a fire alarm?

Tom
It's usually a false alarm anyway.

Paul
That's not the point. Now Anna, what about smoking?

Anna
No smoking on company premises. But it wasn't me, it was Mr Ingle.

All
Mr Ingle!

Paul
I see, so it was Mr Ingle smoking in the warehouse. You should have told me Anna.

Anna
Sorry!

Paul
Right, I'm going to have to look into this. Back to work everyone… oh and take a biscuit with you.

Narrator
So Anna's let the cat out of the bag – Mr Ingle won't be pleased – but at least she now knows what do if a fire breaks out. Here are some of the phrases we've heard today, that can be used in an emergency:
If you see a fire, raise the alarm.
Walk calmly to your nearest fire exit.
Meet at the fire assembly point.
No smoking on company premises.

Tom
Sorry to interrupt Paul… but the fire alarm's going off!

Denise
Don't panic anyone. Everything will be OK. (On phone) Jane, I'll have to call you back… yes, a bit of a panic. Bye. Quick, where's my red pen?

Narrator
Uh-oh. Those emergency phrases might come in useful sooner than you think. Is this going to be the end of Tip Top Trading, will it really go up in smoke? Find out next time. Bye.
