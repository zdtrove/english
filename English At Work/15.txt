Anna
(answering the phone) Yes?

Denise
Stop! That's all wrong. I'm going to call you again. This time…

Narrator
Hello. Here we are in the middle of a telephone training session with Denise and Anna. What fun!

Denise
…this time, you don't say 'yes' when you answer, it's rude. Call me and I'll show you how it's done.
(sound of 4-digit dialling, then phone rings)
Hello? Tip Top Trading.

Anna
Wow, that’s good.

Denise
And, you can say your name. Hello? Tip Top Trading. Denise speaking. Try it.
(dialling, then ring)

Anna
Hello? Tip Top Trading. Denise speaking.

Denise
No!

Anna
What?

Denise
Say: "Anna speaking!"

Anna
Oh, sorry, I'm so stressed by all this. Hello Anna speaking.

Denise
You sound like you're sitting on a pineapple. Listen to my voice: Hello? Denise speaking.

Anna
Hello? Anna speaking.

Denise
Good. Now, when the person has introduced themself – this is Mrs Smith or whatever, say: Hello Mrs Smith, how can I help you? Or, if you know them already, you might say: Hello Mrs Smith, how are you?

Anna
Okay, what if Mrs Smith wants to speak to Tom but he's not there?

Denise
You say: "I'm really sorry, he's not available at the moment. Can I take a message?" Or: "I'm afraid he's busy, shall I ask him to call you back?"

Anna
Okay.

Denise
And, to end a conversation, you can say: "Thank you for calling, goodbye." Let's do another practice!
(phone rings)

Anna
Hello? Tip Top Trading.

Denise
Hello, this is Mrs Smith.

Anna
Hello Mrs Smith, how can I help you?

Denise
I'd like to speak to Tom please.

Anna
I'm really sorry, he's not available at the moment. Can I take a message?

Denise
That's okay, I'll try again later.

Anna
Okay. Thank you for calling, goodbye.

Denise
Excellent!
(phone rings)
Oh!

Anna
How did you call me without dialling?

Denise
I didn't, that's a real call!

Anna
Oh no, I'm all nervous now. Hello? Tip Top Trading. This is Anna speaking.

Mr Lime
Hello Anna, this is Seb Lime.

Anna
Sublime?

Mr Lime
Mr Lime from Citrus Ventures. But I think we should be on first name terms now, so call me Seb.

Anna
Okay, er, Seb. How can I help you?

Mr Lime
I just wanted to say again that your Imperial Lemon is fantastic... and I was wondering if you'd like to do lunch with me sometime?

Anna
Lunch? Er...

Narrator
I knew it! Mr Lime is interested in more than just your lemons!

Anna
Would you like to discuss the Imperial Lemon?

Mr Lime
Forget the lemons Anna! The reason I want to see you is more of a personal nature.

Anna
Personnel? Er... Can I call you back? I'm afraid I'm a bit busy at the moment...

Mr Lime
…bbbut…

Denise
Well Anna! Mr Lime eh?

Anna
Oh dear Denise, I think I need a bit more help from you. He wants to talk about personnel…people, staffing…

Denise
Are you sure? I think he means a personal nature, not personnel! That Mr Lime!

Anna
Oh!

Narrator
Mr Lime indeed. Anyway, Anna had an excellent phone manner. Let's hear those phrases again:

Hello? Tip Top Trading. This is Anna speaking.
Hello? Anna speaking.
Hello Mrs Smith, how can I help you?
Hello Mrs Smith, how are you?
I'm really sorry, he's not available at the moment. Can I take a message?
I'm afraid he's busy – shall I ask him to call you back?
Thank you for calling, goodbye.
But how is Anna going to handle Mr Lime's request? I can't wait till next time! Bye!
