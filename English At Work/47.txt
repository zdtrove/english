Welcome back to English at Work. Anna is acting up as boss because Paul had an accident with a biscuit! But her and Tom are in a panic after finding a note in Paul's diary that said 'Socrates, IPC, final'. Could it mean bad news for Tip Top Trading? Let’s find out.

Tom
It's very odd and it can't be good. But Socrates must mean Mr Socrates.

Anna
Yes – but IPC? What's that mean?

Tom
Yeah and final sounds very… final.  Hmm… I've got it! IPC – it must be code for imminent post closures – they're going to sack us all!

Anna
Sshh. Keep your voice down. Don't tell everyone. Let's check things out first, don't say anything yet. OK?

Tom
OK. Mum's the word.

Anna
Your mum knows?!

Tom
No, no, no, it's our little secret. See you later.

Denise
Everything OK Tom?

Tom
Oh yeah, everything's cool. Actually Denise, it's not. I think we're all going to be sacked tomorrow by Mr Socrates.

Denise
What?! No! I've got a hairdresser's appointment on Saturday, how am I going to pay for it now? What am I going to do? I know, I'll call Marge. 

Tom
Hey Brian, Pete… we're all going to be sacked tomorrow.

Narrator
Erm… Anna, you've got a problem brewing.

Anna
What?

Narrator
Tom's spreading rumours about job cuts. Everyone's starting to panic.

Anna
Oh no! I'd better do something but what shall I say?

Narrator
Call a meeting quickly. Tell the team 'there are some rumours going around that are not true'. Say, 'I am trying to establish the facts and I will let you know as soon as I have some information'. You could say 'I would be grateful if you hear any rumours, not to pass them on'. This can be a tricky situation and you need to handle it well. Good luck!

Anna
Gosh. This is hard but here goes. Excuse me, could everyone gather round please.

Denise
Is this about the sackings?

Anna
No Denise. Any rumours about sackings are not true.

Tom
Yeah that's right. Who told you that Denise?

Denise
Hmmm…

Anna
Please don't listen to rumours. I am trying to establish the facts and if I get any information I will let you know straight away.

Denise
But I heard Mr Socrates is coming tomorrow, surely he’s going to sack us.

Anna
Ignore the rumours and please don't pass them on.

Narrator
Anna. Tell them to carry on with their work as normal.

Anna
Right, yes. Could you please just carry on with your work as normal. Thank you.

Tom
So Anna, how are you going to find out the facts?

Anna
I'm going to have to call Paul – in private Tom – I don't want any more rumours getting out.

Tom
Oh yeah, absolutely. You need to establish the facts right?

Paul
Hello, Paul speaking.

Anna
Oh hi Paul. It's Anna. Sorry to bother you. Are you feeling better?

Paul
Much better thanks but keeping clear of biscuits for a while! Anyway, is everything OK?

Anna
Not exactly. There are rumours spreading about job cuts. Tom saw a note in your diary for tomorrow that said 'Socrates, IPC'.

Paul
Hmm. Really? Oh yes. I mean, oh no! It's not job cuts – it's IPC - the International Plastics Conference tomorrow! And Mr Socrates is flying in for it. Oh golly gosh, I'd forgotten about that.

Anna
I see. And why did you right final?

Paul
Because there's an award being given for the Best Plastic Innovation – and we're in the final with our Imperial Lemon.  It was a reminder to me to write an acceptance speech. Oh golly gosh, I haven't written a thing.

Anna
Oh dear. What are we going to do?

Narrator
What are you going to do indeed? But thank goodness those rumours of job cuts are not true. Tomorrow could actually be a good day for Tip Top Trading. Here's a reminder of the phrases Anna used to try and control the spread of some office rumours:

There are some rumours going around that are not true.

Please don't listen to rumours.

I am trying to establish the facts and if I get any information I will let you know straight away.

Ignore the rumours and please don’t pass them on.

Please just carry on with your work as normal. Thank you.

Narrator
Tomorrow is going to be an important day at the International Plastics Conference. Mr Socrates will be there and Tip Top Trading could pick up a prestigious prize but who’s going to write the acceptance speech?

Paul
OK Anna, this calls for some urgent action. I want you and Tom to meet me at the Princess Diana Conference Centre tomorrow at 9.00.

Anna
Right. And what about the speech?

Paul
Well, I've got quite a lot on my plate so I was wondering if you could give it a go… please?

Anna
Me?! I've never done it before. What am I going to say?!

Narrator
Don't worry Anna. We’re here to help. Join us again soon for some more English at Work. Bye!
