Hello again. It's a difficult day at the offices of Tip Top Trading. The office assistant Denise is losing her job, and today is her last day. Anna is busy with her work and trying to get everyone to sign Denise's leaving card.

Anna
Paul, have you signed Denise's leaving card yet?

Paul
No, not yet. Have you got a pen? "Sorry to see you go. Best foot forward. Paul." There. I feel a bit guilty, it was me who got rid of her.

Tom
Yeah. Well, you should feel really bad. I can't believe you're getting rid of her.

Anna
Tom, do you want to sign the card?

Tom
Yeah, of course. "You are…were…the best employee we ever had. So sad to see you go. Kiss, kiss, kiss. Tom."

Anna
Gosh. Three kisses! Erm, you haven't given me any money for her leaving present yet, have you?

Tom
Oh sorry, a bit of a cash flow problem… Here, have a pound.

Paul
That's generous!

Paul
Oh crumbs, she's crying again. Anna, could you deal with her? I've got something important to do.

Tom
Oh yeah. Me too.

Anna
Denise, are you OK? Are you upset about leaving?

Denise
Yes. I've loved working here. I've made some good friends… like you Anna… Oh, and being able to make free phone calls has been good.  What am I going to do now?

Narrator
Oh dear Anna. It sounds like Denise needs some career advice.

Anna
Career advice?

Narrator
She needs some guidance on what to do next and where to find another job. What would you do in her situation?

Anna
Look in the newspaper, ring my contacts, register with a job agency?

Narrator
Exactly! I'm sure you can give her some good advice. Go on, give it a go!

Anna
OK, I'll try. Cheer up Denise, you need to think positively.

Denise
Do I? I'm unemployed from tomorrow, how am I ever going to find another job?

Anna
Well, have you tried looking in the job section of the newspaper?

Denise
No.

Anna
It's a good place to start. And there are loads of job-finding websites you could sign up for.

Denise
I don't have a computer.

Anna
Well what about ringing some of the people you know; contacts who may know about a job.

Denise
Hmm, I hadn't thought about that.

Anna
And of course, you could register with a recruitment agency. They're good at finding jobs for you.

Denise
Oh, that's a good idea. Anna, you're brilliant! What great ideas… you're so kind and… thoughtful.

Paul
Anna could you… Oh no, she's crying again.

Tom
Oh no, shall we go back into your office Paul?

Anna
No, no. It's OK, Denise is crying with happiness. She's feeling better now.

Paul
Oh well, in that case… shall we all gather round and officially say goodbye to Denise.

Narrator
It's an emotional day for Denise, but Anna has been really useful with her career advice. If a professional career advisor is not available, giving some of your own advice can sometimes be useful. Let's hear again what Anna suggested…

You need to think positively.

Try looking in the job section of the newspaper.

There are loads of job-finding websites you could sign up for.

Paul
OK everyone, the time has come to say farewell to Denise. It's with regret we've had to let her go.

Tom
We? You, Paul.

Pau
Thank you for all your hard work and we wish you very well in the future.

Paul
Anna, I think we have a gift for Denise?

Anna
There you go Denise. Careful, it's quite heavy.

Denise
Oh, what a beautiful fruit bowl… and full of plastic fruit!

Tom
I'll get it. Sorry about that everyone. That was a company called Nice'n'Cheesy, they remember you Anna. They liked your sales pitch and want to order a hundred thousand plastic grapes to go with their cheeses!

Paul
What?! Brilliant! Ooops. 

Denise
My new fruit bowl! 

Narrator
Oh dear. Poor Denise! It looks like she might be leaving the company at just the wrong time. I wonder if she'll be back? You'll have to join us again for the next episode of English at Work. Bye!
