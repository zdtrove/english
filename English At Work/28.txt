Hello again. Tip Top Trading’s big boss, Mr Socrates has announced a new strategy to sell plastic fruit to Europe and hopefully keep the company afloat. But before the real work begins it’s time for him to enjoy some good English hospitality at the pub, courtesy of the team from the London office. Let’s join them now…

Tom
…Well welcome to the Rose and Crown, it is small, not like one of those bars you get in your country. Can I get you a pint Mr Socrates?

Mr Socrates
A what?

Tom
A pint. A pint of beer, it’s really nice here if you like it…

Mr Socrates
I don’t drink. Just an orange juice, freshly squeezed.

Paul
On go on Mr Socrates, one pint won’t hurt. You’ve got to have a pint of beer when you come to a pub.

Mr Socrates
Oh very well. I’ll try one. It had better be good.

Tom
You’ll love it. I’ll get it. Three pints of your best beer please Mr Landlord. Denise, are you OK getting your own? I’m a bit short of cash.

Denise
Oh… right. Mr Socrates, Anna said she would be along soon. She had some work to finish. She’s such a hard worker.

Mr Socrates
Good to hear. She seems like a smart cookie. Now let’s try this beer …mmm, not bad, a little warm but… tasty.

Paul
Oh, you drank that quickly… would you like another one?

Mr Socrates
Sure.

Anna
Hi everyone. Sorry I’m late.

Denise
Hi Anna. Look Mr Socrates is enjoying our English beer. I think it’s going to his head.

Mr Socrates
(Loudly) Anna! Our best worker. Get Anna a drink.

Tom
Yes Mr Socrates. Of course Mr Socrates.

Mr Socrates
Anna, come over here, let’s talk.

Anna
Oh right. What about…

Tom
There you go Anna. I got you some crisps too. So what are we talking about?

Mr Socrates
Nothing. Thank you… bye bye.

Tom
Oh right. Bye bye. Yes, I’ll go and talk to Paul and Denise. I’ll just be over here.

Mr Socrates
What a loser. I can tell he’s all talk and no action.

Anna
Well, Tom’s a good worker really and…

Mr Socrates
…and as for Paul. God, what a manager. Always eating cookies. You know he was fired from his last job because…

Narrator
Anna, I think he’s getting a bit too personal. That beer is making him say things he shouldn’t.

Anna
I know. What should I say?

Narrator
Try saying “it’s not appropriate to talk like that” or “could we change the subject please.”

Anna
OK thanks. Erm, Mr Socrates I don’t think it’s appropriate to talk like that, could we change the subject please?

Mr Socrates
Oh, sorry have I said too much? Maybe we should talk about you. I like you Anna. You’re keen but you’ve got a lot to learn and I think you should wear more black – it makes you look… thinner…

Narrator
He’s out of order. I think he’s saying too much. Ask him to keep the conversation professional.

Anna
Right, good idea. (To Mr Socrates) Erm, Mr Socrates, thank you but can we keep our conversation professional. There’s a lot to discuss about our European market strategy.

Mr Socrates
Yeah, right, absolutely right. Anyway, you’re gonna have to lead this one not that Tom guy. I’m thinking of firing him, his results ain't that great and…

Tom
…sorry to interrupt, just wondered if you’d like some nuts?

Mr Socrates
Hey Tom, I was just saying to Anna your results haven’t been good and I’m thinking of…

Anna
(flustered)… of having another drink… thinking of having another drink. Mr Socrates, did you know Tom actually has a great idea for selling laser-curved oranges to Spain?

Tom
(puzzled) Do I?

Mr Socrates
That’s good to hear Tom. Email them to me and I’ll check them over tomorrow.

Anna
Of course he will, Mr Socrates. Now how would you like to drink something, errr, less strong? Orange juice perhaps?

Mr Socrates
Na, I think I’ll try some more of the English beer.

Narrator
I think Anna has just done Tom a big favour – she’s stopped him getting fired - for now. Sometimes conversations with your boss can get too personal but I think Anna’s got the hang of keeping things professional. Here’s a reminder of what she said:

It’s not appropriate to talk like that.
Could we change the subject please?
Can we keep our conversation professional please?

Narrator
So Anna seems to be Mr Socrates’s favourite team member but now she’s got some explaining to do to Tom.

Tom
Anna, what were you talking about to Mr Socrates? “Ideas for selling laser-curved oranges to Spain”?

Anna
He was going to fire you – so I was trying to tell him you had great ideas.

Tom
What?! You helped me? Anna, I don’t know what to say. I… I… I…

Anna
Yes?

Tom
I… need to go back to the office to work on some ideas.

Narrator
Good idea. Keep it professional, eh Tom? Until next time. Bye!
