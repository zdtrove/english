Narrator
It's late at the offices of Tip Top Trading. Anna is alone, working. Again. She's been doing this all week, she wants her presentation to Mr Lime to be perfect so she's been spending hours and hours on it. Anna?

Anna
Don't interrupt! I'm busy.

Narrator
Woah!

Anna
Sorry.

Narrator
Anna, you're really burning the candle at both ends.

Anna
What?

Narrator
Burning the candle at both ends – it means working very hard – working late and getting up early to work all the time.

Anna
Oh. I didn't know that expression.

Narrator
Well here are some more:
You're doing overtime; which means you're working longer than office hours.
You're putting in the hours; which means you are spending all the time needed to achieve something.

Anna
Yes, I'm putting in the hours to make sure my presentation is perfect.

Narrator
And if you don't mind me saying so, you might burn out; which means you are working so hard that you might get very tired and run out of energy.

Anna
I'm not burning out. I'm full of energy. I just need to finish this bit...

Denise
My goodness, nothing's locked. Do you think we've been burgled?

Tom
Oh no! I left my lap-book and my me-pad on the desk... and my i-top – they're worth thousands! They're all the latest versions!

Denise
I left out my elephant mug and my lady-curve nail file. They better not have stolen them!

Anna
(Talking in her sleep) but it's premium, premium, faux-orange premium!

Tom
Anna?

Denise
It's Anna, she's asleep. Anna!

Anna
(waking up with a jump) Oh! Lemons! Denise? Tom?

Tom
Have you spent the night asleep at your desk Anna?

Anna
Is it morning? Oh dear, yes I think so.

Denise
Well, at least we haven't been burgled then.

Tom
Anna, you've really been burning the candle at both ends lately.

Denise
Yes, you've been doing hours and hours of overtime. Most people get their work done within office hours and anyway, we don't pay overtime here. You’ll never find me working late!

Tom
Yes, I'd noticed that Denise.

Anna
But this presentation must be perfect.

Denise
If you're not careful, you'll burn out! Then you'll really be of no use to anyone. You'll be as useful as a chocolate teapot.

Tom
It's good that you're putting in the hours Anna, but you should calm down. Look at me, I do very successful presentations without spending hours preparing.

Denise
Ha!

Tom
In my presentation to Every Apple I just swooshed in with no preparation after a night on the town. I charmed them. They loved me!

Narrator
Idiot. I bet he actually spent hours preparing he just can't admit it.

Anna
Well, maybe you're right. I can't think clearly anymore, I'm so tired. I need to sleep properly otherwise I'll end up trying to sell bananas instead of lemons.

Narrator
Anna has finally got the message: she's realised she's been working too much. She needs to be realistic. Here's a reminder of some of the phrases we heard to talk about how much Anna had been working:

Burning the candle at both ends.
Doing overtime.
Putting in the hours.
Burning out.
Let's hope she's thinking clearly by the time she has to do her presentation. Join us next time to find out! Bye.
