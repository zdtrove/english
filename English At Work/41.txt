Welcome back to the offices of Tip Top Trading where Tom has taken a tumble. He was trying to catch a mouse but tripped over. Can Anna help soothe the pain? Let's find out.  

Tom
Ooh… oww… ouch. My arm really hurts.

Paul
What's all this noise about?

Denise
It's Tom. He's had an accident – tripped over a mouse – I mean tripped over trying to catch a mouse.

Paul
Golly gosh. Are you OK Tom?

Tom
I dunno. I think I've broken something.

Denise
Your pencil I think! Just sit there at my desk and I'll go and call a first-aider.

Paul
Anna,you're going to have to fill in one of those Health and Safety reports.

Anna
Oh really? Do we have to?

Paul
It's procedure and it's the law – it's got to be done.  Now Tom, would a biscuit make you feel better?

Narrator
Health and Safety is important in the workplace. The office needs to be a safe place to work in, but accidents do happen and that's when you have to report it. Anna, do you know where to find the form you need to fill in?

Anna
I think so. It's here on the company intranet… here it is, 'accident report form'.

Narrator
Yes, it's sometimes called an 'incident or accident report form'. It will ask you: How did the accident happen? What was the cause of the accident? Were there any injuries? And how could the accident have been avoided?

Anna
OK, I had better get started.

Denise
Right, I've call the first-aider. She'll be here in ten minutes. Now, do you need a hand with this form, Anna?

Anna
Yes please Denise. It wants to know how the accident happened. 

Denise
Just say there was a mouse… no, a large rat… running about that needed catching. And Tom, very bravely, tried to catch it

Anna
Yes… and then he tripped over something.

Denise
Was it your ego Tom?

Tom
Err? Ha ha. Ouch! No, it was a sample box of Perfect Peaches.

Denise
So, the cause of the accident was a box of Perfect Peaches left on the floor. Who left them there anyway?

Tom
That might have been me Denise.

Denise
What do I always say about putting things away? Now Anna, it says here 'Were there any injuries?'

Anna
So I'll write, 'Yes, a member of staff broke his arm.'

Denise
Sprainedhis arm. I think he'd be in a lot more pain if it was broken, hey Tom?

Tom
What? Err, yeah. It still hurts though.

Denise
Hmm! Now finally it says 'What can be done to avoid this accident again?'

Anna
Get rid of the mice… I mean rats?

Denise
No. Store things away properly and keep the office tidy, eh Tom?

Tom
Yeah, I suppose so… but I was only trying to catch that mouse.

Denise
I know, very heroic. I'm starting to see what Anna sees in you, you know.

Tom
Oh no, Anna, our dinner date!

Narrator
So, it's been an eventful day in the office. Anna has done the proper thing by completing an accident report form. If you have to report an accident at work, here are some of the questions you might be asked:

How did the accident happen?

What was the cause of the accident?

Were there any injuries? And:

How could the accident have been avoided?

Narrator
So luckily for Anna she might get out of that date with Tom!

Anna
Hey Tom, don't look so glum. I'm up for dinner if you still are?

Tom
Ouch… really?

Anna
Sure Tom, and as you've only got one arm now, you won't be hugging me all the time.

Denise
You'll have to spoon feed him his food too!

Tom
Denise, could you go and call pest control please?

Narrator
Careful what you say Denise, or you may get injured too! So it looks Anna and Tom's dinner date is on – I can't wait to be a fly-on-the-wall! See you again soon. Bye!
