Hello. We're back at Tip Top Trading. Anna is very busy dealing with Mr Lime's big order for Imperial Lemons.

Anna
Yes?... Who?... I can't hear you. Mr what? What? Mr Who? I don't know, you tell me. Oh, you are Mr Hu... H-U: Hu. Er... No, Tom's busy. Call back later. Bye. Tom, Mr Hu called you.

Tom
Mr Hu-

Anna
Mr Hu: H-U

Tom
Anna, Mr Hu is a very important-
Oh! What now?! Yes?

Tom
I'm going to have to talk to the boss about this.

Anna
No. I'm busy, give me your number, I'll call you later. Yep, yep, 6... 8... thanks. Bye! Right, now where was I?

Paul
Anna, could I have a word?

Anna
Yes. Ohhh, he must want to tell me how pleased he is with the Citrus Ventures deal.

Paul
Now, Anna... biscuit?

Anna
Thank you.

Paul
I'm a little bit concerned about something.

Anna
"I'm a little bit concerned..." Doesn't that mean something bad?

Narrator
Yes, Anna, Paul is using a polite turn of phrase to say he is unhappy about something. Let's see what he's got to say....

Paul
I think you need to work on your telephone manner.

Anna
Work on my telephone manner?

Narrator
It means the way you talk on the phone is not good enough and you have to improve it – to work on it to make it better.

Paul
Perhaps you should think about …

Narrator
Perhaps you should think about – that's a polite way of telling you to do something!

Paul
Anna, are you listening to me?

Anna
Yes, sorry, I was just sort of, err, talking to myself. Could you repeat what you said please?

Paul
Right, I'll start again. I said: I'm a little bit concerned about your telephone manner. You need to work on the way you speak to clients. Perhaps you should think about being a bit more polite to clients; it's important for the image of the company.

Anna
Oh okay.

Paul
You can go now – take another biscuit with you – that's my last chocolate wafer, you lucky thing!

Denise
Anna? Is everything all right?

Anna
Yes.

Denise
What's the matter?

Anna
Paul says I need to w-w-w-work on my telephone manner.

Denise
Well I was a bit concerned about it myself. And I think Tom actually mentioned it to Paul.

But, look, I'll help you if you like. I'm a bit of an expert on the phone. I'll give you some lessons.

Anna
Oh thank you.

Denise
Come in early tomorrow morning, before the others get here and we'll practise.

Anna
Thank you Denise, that's very kind.

Narrator
Wow! Denise is actually being nice to Anna. Amazing! Although from what I've heard of Denise on the phone, she's only ever gossiping with friends. Paul was very gentle and polite in the way he explained to Anna there was a problem and that she needed to improve some things. He used these phrases:

I'm a little bit concerned about...
You need to work on...
Perhaps you should think about...
Let's see if Denise manages to teach Anna anything useful next time. Until then!
