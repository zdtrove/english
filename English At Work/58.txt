It's that time again for English at Work. Life in the offices of Tip Top Trading is still hectic. There's so much to do and tomorrow the team is launching its new product – the plastic aubergine – so everyone needs to pull their weight and get things done – quickly. The problem is, some people are a bit slow at being quick!

Anna
Could someone answer that please? I'm on the other line.

Denise
Well I can't, I'm already on the phone.

Tom
Yeah, talking to your friend Marge. And I'm busy… errr… writing a business proposal.

Paul
Could someone just answer that phone… oh, you're all busy. I suppose I'd better do it. Hello? Yes? Really! I'm sorry about that. We'll send someone round right away. Yes, this morning. Bye. Anna, are you free to talk in my office now?

Anna
Yes Paul. What's wrong?

Paul
Hold on – I just need a quick bite on a biscuit – that's better. Now, that was Nice'n'Cheesy. They're not happy about how slowly we are processing their order. They need our plastic grapes for an exhibition they're doing at the weekend.

Anna
But I thought Tom had sorted that out?

Paul
Clearly not. I need you to pull out all the stops and sort this out.

Anna
Pull out what stops?

Paul
I mean do all you can to get this order completed, please.

Anna
But we've got the aubergine launch tomorrow.

Paul
Leave that to me and Denise to organise. It'll be in… safe hands.

Narrator
Hmm, I'm not so sure about that. Anyway Anna, your priority now is the order for Nice'n'Cheesy. You're going to have to tell the team "We have an order we need to process urgently", and "We need to pull out all the stops to get this sorted". You could also say "This is our number one priority" and then delegate tasks to the team to help you get the order sorted. Good luck!

Anna
Oh thanks. Tom, I need your help. It's the order for Nice'n'Cheesy, we need to process it urgently.

Tom
The order? I sent that out ages ago, with the paperwork.

Denise
You mean this paperwork Tom, on your desk?

Tom
Oh no! I must have forgotten. I've had so much to do.

Anna
Well, they're not happy, so we've got to pull out all the stops and get them their grapes.

Tom
OK but what about the aubergines?

Anna
Forget about the aubergines. We've got to get onto this now. It's our number one priority. You go and get the plastic grapes from the warehouse, I'll sort out this paperwork, and I'll meet you downstairs in 15 minutes.

Tom
Why, where are we going?

Anna
We're getting a taxi to the offices of Nice'n'Cheesy so we can hand deliver the grapes.

Tom
Oh right, but isn't it nearly lunchtime?

Anna
There's no time for lunch, Tom. We need to do this now!

Denise
Oh Anna, you're amazing.

Narrator
She certainly is! Anna has wasted no time in sorting out this problem and that's important if you want to keep your business going. Here's a reminder of some of the phrases Anna used:

We've got to pull out all the stops.

We have an order we need to process urgently.

We need to pull out all the stops to get this sorted.

This is our number one priority.

Narrator
Tom and Anna have made it to the offices of Nice'n'Cheesy. Let's find out how they're getting on.

Anna
…so we're really sorry…

Tom
Yeah, really sorry…

Anna
…about the delay, and it won't happen again. And we hope you're pleased with the grapes…

Tom
…and the price!

Jane
Yes, the price is very competitive and if you can guarantee a bit more 'customer care', then I'm sure we'll be buying from you again.

Anna
Yes, of course. Thanks very much and sorry again. We hope to see you again soon. Bye!

Tom
Yeah, yeah, see you.

Tom
Phew, well done Anna. I think you saved the day once again. Hey, hold on, isn't that your boyfriend, Dave from IT, over there?

Anna
It is. But who's he with?

Tom
You mean, who's he holding hands with? It's Julie from accounts!

Anna
No, it can't be… It is! What's Dave doing with another woman?

Tom
I dunno – but I never trusted him. Come on Anna, you need a drink – a big one.

Narrator
Oh dear. Poor Anna, it looks like Dave's been cheating on her, but she needs to keep a clear head for the big launch of the plastic aubergine tomorrow. Will she be led by her head - or her heart? Find out next time on English at Work. Bye!
