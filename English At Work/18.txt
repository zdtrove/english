Hello, Anna's just arrived at her desk to start the day at Tip Top Trading. Paul is walking towards her, eating a biscuit, he looks a bit bothered.

Paul
Anna?

Anna
Yes, Paul.

Paul
Come and have a biscuit in my office.
Now Anna, about Mr Lime.

Anna
I didn't say yes!

Paul
Pardon? Yes to what?

Anna
Oh, nothing.

Paul
You sent him an email yesterday and copied me in.

Anna
Yes.

Paul
Your email reads: boxes ok. pls c-d-u cfirm wnt 300 ta.

Anna
Yes: please could you confirm you want 300.

Paul
Right. Now that's not really the best way of writing an email to a client, is it?

Anna
Oh.

Paul
Please could you re-send your message to Mr Lime, using actual words that make sense.

Anna
Okay.

Paul
Thank you. Have a chocolate crunchy!

Anna
Thanks.

Tom
Morning Anna.

Anna
Hello.

Tom
Let me guess, Paul just spoke to you about your email?

Anna
How do you know?

Tom
You copied me in remember, I just read it – or tried to.

Anna
But what's the problem? Other people write like that!

Tom
No, maybe some people write text messages like that in an SMS message on their phones, but that is completely the wrong style for an email to a client.

Narrator
Okay Anna, let's stop listening to Tom, he's a waste of space. These are the kinds of phrases you need in a business-related email:
Dear Mr Lime...
I hope you are well.
I am writing regarding...
Please could you confirm...
Yours sincerely, or
Best wishes.

Anna
Thank you! I'll rewrite my message. There! I'd better get it checked before I send. Denise?

Denise
(On the phone) yes... the other problem with Stephanie is that her legs are just too long...

Anna
Oh, she's on the phone.

Denise
... yes, like trees...

Anna
I'll have to ask Tom. Tom?

Tom
Mm?

Anna
Could you read this through before I send it?

Tom
Hang on, Anna, let me just finish this sentence. It’s really important. I’m ready, let’s have a look. Okay. (reading) Dear Mr Lime, I hope you are well. I am writing regarding your request for luxury boxes for the Imperial Lemon Delivery. We will indeed be able to supply them. Please could you confirm that you want 300. Best wishes, Anna.

Anna
Well?

Tom
It’s good, it's much better. Send it. Hopefully Mr Lime will think your last message was just someone sitting on your keyboard by mistake.

Anna
Thanks.

Tom
You're not...

Anna
What?

Tom
Nothing. It's none of my business.

Anna
What?

Tom
You're not ever going to go to lunch with Mr Lime are you? I mean, in a non-business way...

Anna
No of course not!

Tom
I mean I don’t care… it's just... important to... stay professional.

Anna
Yes.

Narrator
Hmmm.... well, I had a feeling Anna's email was going to cause problems. But at least she won't make a mistake like that again. Here’s a reminder of the phrases she used in her new, improved email.

Dear Mr Lime...
I hope you are well.
I am writing regarding...
Please could you confirm...
Best wishes.
Until next time, bye!
