Here we are again at Tip Top Trading, where Anna's interview for a sales job has been suddenly interrupted. Office assistant Denise has entered the room, looking very worried. What's wrong? And will Anna have any suggestions that might help?

Denise
I don't know what to do!

Paul
So what's the matter Denise?

Denise
You know the PowerPoint presentation?

Paul
The one we've been preparing for the last two months?

Denise
Yes.

Paul
The one that's very, very important and that we need this afternoon?

Denise
That one.

Paul
Aha.

Denise
We've lost everything!

Paul
No!

Denise
I had it on a USB stick, to transfer it, but the stick has vanished!

Narrator
Right Anna, now is your chance to help them find solutions to the problem.
You'll need phrases like:

Can I make a suggestion?
Why don't you...?
Have you tried...?
Maybe we could...?
How about...?
I have an idea!
Paul
But don't you have it saved on your computer?

Denise
No, it was taking up a lot of space, so I deleted it.

Paul
So you have lost the only copy we have.

Denise
Yes.

Narrator
What idiots! I've never seen such a disorganised office. Go on, you'd better help them, Anna.

Anna
Can I make a suggestion?

Paul
Yes, please do!

Anna
Why don't you try looking in your recycle bin? It might still be there.

Denise
I did. It isn't.

Anna
Have you tried asking your colleagues if they've seen the memory stick?

Denise
I did. They haven't.

Anna
How about looking through your rubbish bin to see if you threw it away by mistake?

Denise
(getting shirty) I don't do silly things like that!

Paul
All very sensible suggestions Anna, thank you.

Anna
Maybe I could do a big office search for you...? I'm good at finding things.

Denise
There are confidential documents in this office – non-staff are not allowed to see them.

Paul
Now, now Denise. Why don't you drink up that nice tea?

Anna
I have an idea! Did you ever email the presentation to anyone?

Paul
Golly gosh, you did Denise! You emailed it to me to proof-read. It'll be in my inbox somewhere. Good thinking Anna!

Denise
I was just about to suggest that myself.

Paul
Problem solved. Thank you Anna!

Anna
Pleasure.

Narrator
Well done Anna!

Paul
Right, now please leave us Denise. Anna and I will continue our interview. Would you like a biscuit Anna?

Anna
Thank you. Oh, what's that?

Paul
Oh golly gosh, the USB stick! It was mixed in with the plate of biscuits that Denise brought in.

Anna
It's wet

Paul
Yes, I think maybe I stirred my tea with it at one point. Oh well. Now, where were we...? My goodness, it's 11 o'clock! I have a meeting right now! I'm afraid I'm going to have to go. But I've made my mind up about you anyway. I suppose you'd like to know if you've got the job?

Anna
Yes please!

Narrator
Ah - Stop right there! I'm sure everybody would like to know if Anna's got the job – but everybody's going to have to wait until we've heard her helpful phrases once again:

Can I make a suggestion?
Why don't you try looking in your recycle bin?
Have you tried asking your colleagues if they've seen the memory stick?
How about...?
Maybe I could do a big office search for you...?
How about looking through your rubbish bin...?
I have an idea!
Paul
Anna, we need someone who can think on her feet and who is a first-rate people person. Someone who sees solutions, not problems... someone like you! So if you want the job, it's yours!

Narrator
Ah, now think carefully Anna – do you really want to work for these people? They seem a bit... disorganised.

Anna
I would definitely like the job! Thank you!

Narrator
So be it. Join us again next week for Anna's first day as a sales executive at Tip Top Trading.
