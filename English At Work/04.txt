Last week, Anna got the job of sales executive at Tip Top Trading, thanks to her quick-thinking in an office crisis. Today it's her first day in the office. How are you feeling now, Anna?

Anna
Excited, but a bit worried. I really want to make a good first impression.

Narrator
Well, you're going to need some phrases to introduce yourself politely, such as:

Hello, I don't think we've met.
You must be – and say the person's name.
I've just joined the team.
Nice to meet you.
Have you worked here long?
Why don't you start by saying hello to Tom Darcy, the Senior Account Manager?

Tom
Yah, yah, no, yah, yah, OK, yah. I'll seal the deal, yah, no worries. OK, see ya mate, bye!

Anna
Hello, I don't think we've met.

Tom
No.

Anna
You must be Tom. I'm Anna. I've just joined the team.

Tom
Uh huh.

Anna
Nice to meet you. Have you worked here long?

Tom
Sorry, I'm quite busy right now – I've got a big deal just coming through. But let's get together sometime. Um... can you do lunch tomorrow?

Anna
You want me to do lunch? Well, I'm not very -

Tom
Sorry, important client. Lunch tomorrow at 12.30 then?
(On the phone) Tom speaking. Yah! Frankie! So what's the latest, are we on?

Anna
Well, OK then.

Narrator
Great Anna! You used some nice phrases to introduce yourself. It's a shame Tom thinks he's too important to do the same.

Anna
I'm sure he's just busy. But I'm a bit worried about tomorrow!

(The next day…)

Anna
Good morning Paul!

Paul
Good morning Anna, are you OK?

Anna
Fine, the kitchen's through there, isn't it?

Paul
Er, yes.

Denise
Anna!

Anna
Oh hi, Denise!

Denise
What are you doing?

Anna
Cooking lunch for Tom.

Denise
You what?

Anna
Tom asked me to have lunch ready for 12.30.

Denise
Did he indeed?

Tom
Er, Anna.

Anna
Hi Tom!

Tom
What are you doing?

Anna
Spring rolls, followed by crispy duck in black bean sauce.

Tom
No, I mean, why are you cooking?

Anna
Well, if I don't start now, it won't be ready for you by 12.30.

Tom
Oh, you misunderstood me, Anna. When I said "Can you do lunch?" it didn't mean "Can you make lunch?" It meant "Are you available to come to lunch with me?" In a cafe or something.

Anna
Oh!

Paul
Mmm... something smells good, but what's going on here?

Denise
Anna thinks it's her job to cook for people!

Anna
No, no, I misunderstood!

Tom
Anna just got a bit confused.

Paul
Well, never mind, it looks tasty.

Anna
There's enough for everyone if you want some.

Paul
I think that's a splendid idea, we can have an office picnic!

Anna
Yes!

Paul
Mmm, that sauce looks delicious.

Anna
Yes, it's my favourite.

Narrator
Well, once again everything has worked out well for Anna! Before we go, a reminder of the phrases she used:

Hello, I don't think we've met.
You must be Tom.
I've just joined the team.
Nice to meet you.
Have you worked here long?
Just remember - if somebody says "Would you like to do lunch?" they're not usually expecting you to cook for them! Goodbye.
