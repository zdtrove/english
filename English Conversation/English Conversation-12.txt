[I'm] very happy with your product, and I hope I will be happy with the cost

Well, that's what we are going to talk about today the cost

Will your product be very expensive or will it be cheap?

expensive or cheap

well our

product cost is a little high but

Don't forget you will have more production and better quality, so you will not lose money

But how much will it cost?

Well that depends on how much you order

if you order a lot the cost will be a little lower and

if I order a

little bit if you order only a little bit the cost will be higher, so

How much does it cost well?

one bottle of our product

costs about

$20 [oh] mark. That's very expensive

But don't forget we can negotiate the price

You mean I can bargain with you

yes, and I can discount the price for you Greg, but I

Knew you would say that

but

you must order a lot to get a good price and

if I ordered just a little bit I said [before] the price will be high and

What are the terms of payment?

well

You have a one-year contract

Okay, and you can make one large payment, or you can divide into monthly payments

Let's see I would

Much rather pay by month no problem. [that's] okay

How much?

will

500 bottles cost per month

500 bottles

Okay, let's see

There you go. How's that that's not bad, but

This is better. [well] ah

You can buy our product at this price only if you buy

1000 bottles six hundred

eight hundred and fifty seven hundred

Seven Hundred and fifty it's a deal okay

Well, you are very good at bargaining Mark. Well you can negotiate the price very well also Tim

Thank you. Well I

Guess everything is finished then okay? [I] know you will be very happy with our product

[I] hope I can agree with you, but if there are any problems [I] have your guarantee
