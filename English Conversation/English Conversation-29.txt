Look at all these advertisements for apartments. How will I find the one for me come on Monica?

We'll find you the perfect place don't worry [I]

Need a simple place a bedroom a small kitchen a bathroom and a living room

Let's start looking at the University area

Here I found the section

Hmm. You're right there are lots of places to rent

This one sounds nice. It says

one-bedroom apartment with

kitchen bathroom and large living room

Plus it has a small balcony

It's not far from school, and there's a park in the neighborhood

Angie that sounds really nice. I really want one with a dining room plus all the things I'm looking for the bedroom the kitchen

The bathroom and the living room. It doesn't have a balcony

It doesn't matter does it sounds lovely anyway

Yeah, you're right. Let's give them a call and see if we can see it tomorrow

you

[Ng]. Look these wooden floors

they're beautiful [ah]

I love this Balcony. [oh]

I bet the view of the bosphorus Bridge at night is so romantic

Yes, and look there is a small garden in the back and has some pretty flowers in it right now

Yes, I like this garden, too. Let's look at the kitchen now

Hmm. It's nice

There's a window with another small Garden

Yeah, it needs some work and some

Tiles it's not bad. It's kind [of] small

Yeah

The [real-estate] agent said you can leave [some] of your things in the basement

There's plenty of room to leave the things that you're not using

It would be great to keep my bike down there when I'm not using it in the winter

Let's look at the bedroom

It is a small room

But it has a balcony

It gets lots of light though

You'll only be able to put one small bed in there

Hmm, you're right

What about the bathroom?

It's very small

No, it doesn't even have a bath

The tiles look new so does the sink and toilet but it's very small and no bath is a big turn-off

Yeah

The wood floors are nice, and it's good size, but remember there is no dining room

She'll have to use this space for table and chairs

Yes, and the kitchen is too small to eaten isn't it hmm shall. [we] see the other apartment

It's only two streets away

Okay, I like this place, but I should see them both

oh

Look, Angie this apartment is much bigger than the first one yes, and there is even [more] light, [too]

I like this big living room and this must be the dining room. Yes, and there's even two big windows

It's nice. I really like this fireplace

Look, how nice a kitchen. Is. There's a beautiful refrigerator a stove

And a nice big cabinet for storing food and dishes really like the wooden floors

Monica. Where's the bathroom?

Angie you won't believe it, but it has a Jacuzzi [oh]

fantastic can I come [over] and have a bath sometime my apartment doesn't have a bath of

Course you can my bath is your bath

Well, just one more room to see [what] is the bedroom like well. It's right here

No surprises in this room. It's the same wooden floors. It's a nice place. Yes

So this place has a dining room a living room a nice bedroom a kitchen

Wooden floors and a Jacuzzi so cousin which one will it be I like this one much better

better find out a little more [I]

Don't even know how much it costs of course. I was so excited about sharing the Jacuzzi

Let's stop talking and get busy

Monica where should we move these things in your living room? Well the sofa can go over there next to the counter

The dining room table can go just in front of the wall

Over there, what about this plant on the table?

Hey everyone. I'm really amazed at how quickly we painted this room. It looks really great. - yes. I think the color is really nice

The Air in here is really bad, [and] we've been painting all day I

Cousin there are seven of us you saw how Sam and Jackie. Do you really want to take a fall out for dinner?

Yes, well Michael was kind enough to buy [us] four pizzas for lunch

So it's my turn to say thank you. What would everyone like for dinner. [I] want Chinese food chicken and black bean sauce

[I] haven't had greek food in a long time or we could try something different [a] kebab house

You know the place in the corner. We can go there?

For dinner I like Spanish food

Viola and tapas would be great, but we can't find them in istanbul

Hmm pizza for lunch was easy compared to all these choices [I]

Hello, Sam. Hello, sit down. I have some questions to ask you

Tell me about your computer skills. Well, there are many things I can do with computers. I like programming them I

enjoy helping people to learn about how to use computers I can use a spreadsheet for financial reporting and

I've done a little bit of software writing

Wow, that's impressive

Well, I like working with computers very much

What else can you do with technology?

Well my friends say that I'm very good at stalling and setting up computers

Well this job is mostly helping computer users at our help desk

Well my friends say that I have a lot of patience and then I can help them do

Everything from take the computer out of the box to getting them on the [internet] well, Sam

You're still working for an English teaching company at this time [ok] work a few hours after this job and on Saturdays

Yes, I think the experience that I would get here would be great

Now this is part-time work. We will be paying you $30 an hour, but you should know that if you do well

We would consider hiring you in the summer, and you would be paid more that sounds great

I'm trying to decide whether [I] should go to a course for computers or not

Well your skills are impressive and perhaps working here will help you decide well

I want to know all kinds of applications now, so this job can help me understand. How technology is used in business

[ok] can you start [the] Saturday the hours are noon to [6:00] p.m.. Yes I can be here

I think you will like it here. We're glad [to] have you on our technology and support team. I'm very glad to thank you

We'll see you on Saturday. Come here around 11:30, and we'll do the paperwork [ok] see you then. Thank you

You know I sure could use some fresh air, and I would love to [look] at the sea

Me too, the city is very exciting, but it'd be nice to have a change

Yeah, I like the city a lot, but it's nice to get out once in a while. Anybody have any ideas

Hey, I have an idea [my] landlord has a cottage to the village not far from IsTanbul

He's always telling me I can go out there

Why don't you guys come out with me this weekend?

That is a great idea. We can leave early on Saturday morning and spend the day out there

How would we get there?

Would we take a boat a train or a car?

How far is it from Istanbul? It's not that far about 60 kilometres from the city

Yes, we had our own plane. It would be only about 10 minutes to fly there. Yes

But since none of us have a plane let's think of other ways to get there

[your] [writer] would be fun if we had a plane though

How do you think we should go I went there last year?

And it's very easy to take the bus you get off in the village then you have a short walk to my landlords cottage

Or how about riding a bike?

Running a bank is fun, but I like the idea of going by bus. It will be quicker than going by bike

[ok] well, I will find out about the bus schedules and let you all know when the buses leave

What will we do when we get there?

Well, I know that no one's there this time of year therefore first we have to eat something

There must be some fresh vegetables in the garden

In fact we could have our lunch in the garden. There's a nice patio with a big table for company

It sounds like a really nice place. Are you sure your neighbors will be happy to see you and your three friends around

Don't worry. I know a few neighbors. They are all very nice

After lunch, I'm sure a few of them will pop in to offer to show us around

This sounds like a really nice day

How will we get to the bus on Saturday [I]?

Think we could meet for an early breakfast, and then take a taxi to the bus station. Yeah that way, we'll all be together

And can share the cab fare I?

Can bring a football and we can play on the beach? Oh, that'd be great. I played football there last year

There are always people having fun on the beach

What if it rains?

Well one day a trade last year when I was there

We set up this little beach cafe, and watch the storm go by it was a beautiful day at the beach

That sounds good too. So how should I dress for our little trip?

Well, I will wear shorts to travel out there, and then I will change into my bathing suit for the beach

I can change back into my dry clothes at the house

I like to shop when I visit different places are there any beach stores for shopping

Yes, there are some good places to go. I shop there with my landlord last year. Well, why you boys are playing football?

Maybe I could do some shopping

Yeah, I think you would [enjoy] that more angie

Right Sam you know we have made all these plans for our trip

But we don't even know if the cottage will be available on Saturday

Jack you're right. We plan this whole trip and we don't even know if my landlord is going to say yes for this weekend

I'll ask him when I get home, and I will call to check the bus departure times for Shalay for Saturday morning

Angie don't forget we have to come back from our little chip to Sheila

So see what time the buses come back to the city?

Okay, yes, good point

[yell], have some more information for our trip by lunchtime tomorrow, okay me too. I can't wait for our trip me, too

Okay, Carrie. I know that the restaurant is somewhere around here. [I]

know it is -

Look, I have a map. So let's take a look a well first

Let's see if we can find out where [it] goes. So where are we?

Okay, we're in the park. See here it is on the map

Okay, I think the restaurant is all Mr.. Class street. How do we get there?

Let's See first we leave the park

Then we walk to Taksim Square

Do you see it on the map? Yes I do

[then] where

We walk through Taksim Square

The flower sellers are here and the statue is in the middle. Do you understand so [far]? Yes I do

You know you're better at reading maps

and I am so you can be in charge of this and you can tell me where to go [and]

[better] at reading maps. Do you remember when we went to Monica's gallery opening?

We got lost because you can read the map. Hey that was not completely my fault

[you] know the roads were closed and we had to take a different road. That's why we got lost

Sure, Sam the Road

We took was on the map, but you didn't believe it and of course you didn't want to ask

Anyone for directions. [I] asked after a while

Yes, but only because [we] were tired of being lost men they never asked for directions

And we waste a lot of time being lost all right [Kari] today

You can read the map and you can be in charge of getting us there and if necessary you can ask the directions

Okay, now back to the map

See, we'll pass the statue and along the tram where tricks that is easy because they follow us to cal street

So where is this to Klaus Street? It's an Istanbul

Very Clever carry now. Where is it on the map?

right here see

Okay, now I have to go to the post office while we're going to the restaurant

Where is it?

Here it is. It's on the corner of [Essa'] [cow] and unique A/c it's across from the Big Bank

It's also next to Les [Ray] high school. [oh]

Galatasaray is that the same as the team?

Yes, it is. That's where it started

That's interesting. They're a great team. [I] hope they win the cup again

I'm sure they will one of these days now Sam back to looking for the restaurant

[Angie] is going to meet us at McDonald's, and then we will go the place. We're looking for ah

So we have to find McDonald's first

Yes, that is easy see here on the map. There is a mosque ah

I see it

McDonald's is across the street not far from the mosque

Okay, so is the restaurant down the street or up the street from there it is down the street

We have to walk about 10 minutes. I think can we take the Tramway [oh]

Sam we're walking down the street. It's a nice day, [so] let's just walk

Okay, Carrie. I guess I'm just feeling a bit lazy

It'll be a nice walk now. Let's look at the map [again], okay

Here's the mosque, and there's the post office near the bank

Yes, I'm with you so far

[look] down here and turn left at this street. It's just past the hotel

We walk 100 meters, and then it's on the right I know this place. I've [been] there before

Sam why are you tell me this before? I forgot until just now. We don't need the map. I can show you the way

Okay, Sam, but remember if we get lost I'm going to ask for directions

All right Carrie. Let's put the map in your pocket, and we'll find the post office McDonald's and the restaurant

Okay, Angie is probably waiting for us, so let's go good idea. I'm hungry ready for lunch

Okay, let's go, then [I]

Really want to make this interview interesting Alexei. I know me, too

We're really lucky that my dad knows the coach of the team

Everyone wants to talk to Kody, and he'll be talking to [us] this afternoon

Everyone at work is talking about our interview with a forward from a famous team. I can't wait to meet him

Well, let's go over [our] notes and see if we have all the questions. We want to ask him, okay?

For my journalist friend. I learned that a good interview or news story answer six questions

Who what when where? [why] and how?

Okay, well let's see. I think we have questions that start with all of those

Let's go out to the stadium our interview is at 5 p.m.. And we shouldn't be late. Okay. Let's go

I hope he shows up. I really want to meet him

Hi, you must be Alexi and Angie. It's nice to meet you. My name is [Kody] [I]

Understand that you have some questions for me yes, it's nice to meet you kody. Thank you for meeting with us today

Hi, Kody. My name is [Alexy]. It's really nice to meet you

[I] watch all [of] your games, and I love to see you win every time oh

Thanks. It's nice to know that you're a fun. [I] watch your games, too. Oh

That's even better. I have two fans here. So what about this interview. I will be happy to [answer] any of your questions

Okay, we're ready Alexi. Do you want to go first [sure]?

Kody I read you come from a small [town]

What was it like growing up in a small town?

dusty

Seriously, it was very dry and our little farm was always dusty

So you lived on a ranch with cattle?

Yes, a few hundred [heads]. I grew up riding horses and helping my family on the ranch

We grew some crops too, but mostly it was cattle ranch when did you learn to play football [ah]?

Well, that's easy

High school was a lot [more] fun for me

because I played football then and

Really liked to play the game from the beginning

What position did you play then I've always been a forward I have a strong right arm from roping Cattle [all] those years

Tell me about your four years at the university you were national champions for two years in a row. How did that feel?

We won the national championship two years in a row [it] felt great

Now you live in Istanbul most of the year

What's it like [living] in such a big city?

Well, I have to say it has taken some getting used to

Everything moves pretty fast and it was really noisy for me at first, but now I'm used to it. This is [a] more personal question

Who are you dating?

Whoa, Angie, [I] thought you only wanted to talk about football well my friends at school want to know the answer to that question

Some say you are dating Mariah Carey others say you are seeing Cameron Diaz

Well, I know both [of] them, and they're fine women next question please

When are you going [to] start training for next season? Oh?

Thanks, Alexi a football question

Training camp starts in early july for us where were you trained this year?

We'll be in our training Camp in Istanbul in

One week we'll start training for next season

What can we expect from the team this [year]? We're healthy and hungry for another great season

Our team is going to work really hard for another great year last

Question kody, and it's about football. Why do you love to play?

Well the answer is really simple

It's far less dusty than working on my Family's ranch

Great. That's it. Thank you very much kody. Thanks

Hey, you guys I have something to tell you I have a secret and I have to tell someone

Okay, all right. I'm curious. What is the secret well?

Somebody told me something and I think it is interesting

Okay, well, what is the something that you know?

Well, I was over at a Lexi's house the other day and his mother told me his birthday is coming up next week

Well, that's not much of a secret Angie everyone has a birthday

Yes, everyone has [a] birthday, but Alexi told his mom that he was afraid that since he was new in town

No one would know it was his birthday, [and] no one would help him celebrate I

Get it

Alexi is afraid that when his birthday arrives

Nothing will happen because nobody will know it's his birthday

Yes, exactly

Well, I think we should give our friend a nice birthday to remember. I'm sure everywhere the Christakis has have lived

Alexie's friends have given him a nice birthday. I know which plans something, but what should we do?

Well anyone is having a birthday wants to be the center of attention ah?

[I] don't [know] about that not everyone likes to be the center of attention on his or her birthday

That's true. Not everyone likes to be noticed on special days

everyone's different

Well then

Should we take a shower [in] the city? That's a great idea

He liked all parts of the city

There's no where we've taken him that he hasn't liked. He likes everything about Istanbul. That's true

Anywhere that we've taken them and anything [that] was shown him. He liked very much

Well anybody can remember a birthday, but not everybody could make it special. [I] have an idea now

Uh-oh another idea from Angie this could be almost anything

Well, do you have any ideas for [Alexis] birthday?

Well, no, all right now

Well, here's my idea

Alexis birthday is Friday. So after work. Why don't [we] go to istic? ['el] street. We could do a little shopping for gifts

Good idea great stores there

go on

Well after some shopping we could take into the Marmara hotel cafe

helots the hamburgers there and so do I ah

This is sounding better and better all the time

What else well after some food?

What's better than a little music?

[ah] you are doing really well keep going when I heard it was Alexis birthday, and I found out it was on Friday. [I]

bought four tickets for the sting and U2 concert ah

Angie that is fantastic

I can't believe it. We're all going to see a great show

LexI will have a great birthday. This is super, [ahh]?

What's Super? Oh?

Nothing. [uh] we were just talking about something boring. Oh

Yeah

Something boring nothing interesting at all yes, uh no one finds this topic interesting at all

Okay, guys if no one finds this interesting

Then why are you talking about it well to be honest it is a secret a secret

[I]

hate it when some people know a secret and

Some other people don't know a secret

That's awful. Well. We know something, but we have to keep it a secret for a few more days

Just don't make any plans for next Friday, okay, okay?
