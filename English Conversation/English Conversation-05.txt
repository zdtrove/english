No, they are not.

Lisa, can you show Mr. Smith the
competitor analysis that we did?

Here it is, Mr. Smith.

Oh, I see that our prices are higher
than these brands that you’ve researched.

You understand me now?

Yes, I do understand, but I can explain.

Well, I’m willing to listen.

There are 3 reasons why we
cost more than our competitor.

Ok

Firstly, we use plastic and not
paper to make our products.

So?

Plastic is stronger and more durable.

Ok, I see.

Secondly, we have a 24-hour service
hotline, should there be any problems.

Yes, I have used this before

Were they helpful?

Yes, I suppose they were.

And thirdly, we have a 30 day
return and refund policy

Ok. None of your competitors offer this.

Yes, I know.

But I still think you are too expensive.

But we are the best.

But I can no longer afford it.

This is a difficult situation.

Look! I have to lower my expenditure.

How long have we done business together?

15 years, and I’ve been a good customer.

Ok, I can give you a 7% discount.

Ok, look David. Can you
give me a 10% discount?

No, I'm sorry I can't.

Ok, I'll take the 7% discount

Great. I hope that’s helpful.

Well, Ok.
At least I don’t have to change suppliers now

Good, I’ll send the new
contracts over tomorrow.

I’m look forward to receiving them.
