1. My social life
2. My current job
  1.1 The project I am working on is an e-commerce project, the project's backend using nodeJs (express) and the frontend of the project using nextJs.
  1.2 My team consists of 6 people, 1 translator, 1 team leader, 2 people working on the backend, 2 people working on the frontend including me.
  1.3 My day job is to take the task, estimate the time to do the task, then I will start coding.
  1.4 After completing the task, I will check the code, functionality, user interface and test the old functions related to this task again before giving it to the team leader.
  1.5 Then the team leader will check again, if there is anything wrong, give feedback and I will start to fix the feedback.
  1.6 This will be repeated until everything related to the task is perfect, then the team leader will deploy to the dev server for a final test before notifying the client that the task is complete.
