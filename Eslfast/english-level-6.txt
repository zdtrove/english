1. THE HAIRSTYLE CHANGE

A different hairstyle or color can change a person's entire look. 
It can make a person look better or worse. 
Jean was about to enter her first day of college. 
She wanted a new look. 
Her current hairstyle was nice, but it was boring. 
She had it since she was a 9th grader. 
Her hair right now was straight, long, and blonde.
She went into the hair salon and asked for the hairstylist. 
"What kind of look are you going for?" the hairstylist asked. 
"I want to look like a model," Jean said. 
"Well, we can add layers to your hair. 
We can also make your hair more blonde," the hairstylist said. 
"That sounds good!" Jean said. 
Jean sat in the chair while the hairstylist cut her hair. 
Jean couldn't see herself in the mirror because she didn't have her glasses on. 
She just trusted the hairstylist. 
An hour later, the hairstylist said, "Done!" Jean put on her glasses and looked at herself. 
She looked totally different! 
She liked it, but felt strange. 
She could barely even recognize herself.
Jean asked her friends and family what they thought. 
Most of them liked it. 
They said it made her look edgier, but very different. 
In fact, when she met up with her friends, they asked who she was. 
One of them even tried calling the police when Jean showed up in front of her house.
When Jean was shopping with her friends at the mall, a model scout came up to her and asked if she would consider modeling. 
Jean said she would think about it and took his business card. 
The new hairstyle was really working out for her.

"I'm too scared to talk to strangers," Albert said. 
"Don't worry, I will go with you!" Kelly said.
All of them went to the house to the right.

A couple of weeks later, the manager gave Ophelia a letter. 
The letter stated that her request was rejected.
Ophelia was shocked. 
She went to her manager and asked him why. 
He said that many night shift workers who requested an earlier shift were elderly. 
Ophelia was only 25. 
The manager thought that the older employees needed an earlier shift more than Ophelia did.
Ophelia was mad at first, but she thought about the older employees. 
Their bones were aching and they're tired.

Every day Tiffany jogged 5 miles around her house. 
She loved running around her neighborhood. 
It made her feel refreshed for the rest of the day. 
She felt more healthy and productive after her runs. 
She did not always run the same route. 
She liked to change her route to make running more fun. 
Sometimes she ran to grocery stores and sometimes she ran to her friend's house. 
It was a new journey each time.
In order to run, she had to have the right gear. 
She always wore quality athletic clothes. 
She had to wear good running shoes that were durable. 
She kept her hair in a high ponytail so her hair would not interfere with her face. 
She kept a water bottle with her at all times to continue to stay hydrated.
Sometimes she ran at the gym, but she preferred the fresh air. 
There was something about seeing the trees and cars passing by, which made her happy.
She always listened to music when she ran. 
The music kept her motivated and distracted her from the feeling of being tired.
Today she decided to run to a movie theater. 
She was meeting a friend there later. 
She had her water, music, and a smile ready.

23. A LONELY PUPPY

Rebecca was going on her daily jog when she saw a lonely puppy on the sidewalk. 
The puppy was alone. 
She did not see its owner anywhere in sight. 
The puppy had a collar. 
She checked the collar for an address or identification, but there was none. 
The puppy followed her and began to play with her. 
The puppy seemed to really like Rebecca. 
Rebecca loved dogs and did not mind at all. 
She wanted to help this puppy find its owner. 
She did not want to just abandon him.
She decided to take a picture of the dog and post fliers around her town. 
She hoped that the puppy was local to the area. 
For the time being, she took the puppy home. 
She bought dog food and prepared a nice area for the puppy to sleep. 
The puppy seemed confused in its new environment. 
It was a little shy, but still showed a liking to Rebecca.
The next day, Rebecca posted fliers all over town. 
She added her phone number in case anyone wanted to contact her about the dog. 
She hoped that she could find its owner. 
She decided to take the dog for a walk. 
She started to form a connection with the dog, but she knew she could not keep him.
A few hours later, a woman contacted her about the dog. 
She was so relieved Rebecca had found him. 
Rebecca returned the puppy to the woman and could see how happy both of them were. 
Rebecca felt great and decided she would get a puppy in the future.

The vase in the middle of the house was broken. 
Someone had knocked down the family's vase. 
The mom was furious. 
She had treasured that vase and was upset that it was now broken. 
She did not know who broke it since she was not home that day. 
The only two people who were home were her daughter Violet and son Harry. 
She asked them who broke the vase. 
Both of them were quiet. 
They refused to answer, in fear of getting in trouble.
She threatened to punish both of them if they did not give her an answer. 
They began to blame each other. 
They began to yell and tell their stories at the same time. 
She told each to explain their sides. 
Violet explained that they were playing tag and Harry tagged her while pushing her at the same time causing her to knock the vase over. 
Harry explained that Violet tried to dodge his tag and hit the vase. 
There was no way for the mom to tell who was actually right.
The mom decided it was an innocent mistake. 
She did not punish either of them. 
She just told them not to play tag in the house anymore. 
Harry and Violet had to be more careful next time. 
They apologized to their mom. 
They both felt terrible for upsetting her. 
They decided to be super good and started cleaning up the house.

25. THE FIRST DATE

I have been in the same math class as Eric for a few months now. 
He always helps me on my homework. 
He is extremely nice and funny. 
One day, I decided to ask Eric if he wanted to go out with me to the mall. 
I was so happy when he said yes. 
I was excited; this would be my first date. 
I was also nervous since I had never been on a date. 
I did not know what to do or how to act. 
I hoped I would figure it out.
I planned our date to the minute. 
I wanted to be prepared and know exactly what to do. 
We were going to the mall on Saturday at noon. 
He was going to pick me up and drive to the mall, where we would get food, and then shop at our favorite stores.
However, when the day came, everything went wrong. 
First of all, I could not find my favorite outfit that I had planned on wearing. 
I settled for a clean plain t-shirt and some jeans. 
He was also late because his car got a flat tire on the way to my house. 
I was scared about what else could go wrong. 
He apologized about being late, and I forgave him.
We talked in the car and played music as we drove. 
We had a good conversation about school, traveling, and family. 
He was easy to talk to. 
I was so relieved. 
The date ended up being really fun. 
We had a good time eating and shopping at the mall.

She was excited to begin her Do-It-Yourself project. 
She looked up a bunch of tutorials and videos on arts and crafts. 
There were many easy projects. 
She could make the decoration on her own instead of having to buy it at a store, which would save her money and also allow her to customize her decorations.
She was excited to start these projects. 
She began by printing a bunch of pictures of her family and friends. 
She wanted to remember the important people and the memories they made.

28. MICHELLE'S NEW LOOK

Michelle was tired of how her hair looked. 
She always kept it in a high ponytail. 
She had long brown hair, which had been her hairstyle for her whole life. 
She did not hate it, but she wanted to make a change. 
She thought this was the perfect time to change her hair. 
She thought about what she could do.
She could change the color of her hair. 
Michelle was open to dying it black or a lighter brown. 
She did not want anything too colorful and attention catching. 
She settled on dying it a lighter brown. 
Michelle also wanted to get highlights instead of dying all her hair. 
She thought that would make it look more interesting.
Another option Michelle had was to cut her hair. 
Since she always had long hair, she thought about cutting her hair short. 
She decided she would cut her hair and donate her hair. 
Her hair was long enough to donate. 
Her hair had also never been dyed, so she had extremely healthy hair. 
Michelle was excited for her new look. 
She looked up pictures for reference to show the hair stylist.
Michelle went to the hair salon the next day.

30. THE JOB SEARCH

Sarah wanted to get a job to save up money for her future. 
She did not want to keep asking her parents for money. 
She thought getting a job would be a good way to build her experience. 
Since she never had a job before, she decided to start with a simple part-time job. 
There were a lot of options out there. 
She could be a cashier, a tutor, a waitress, or an usher. 
She decided that a cashier job would be most suitable for her. 
This was a job that seemed simple enough that she could learn. 
It would also let her interact with people, which is her favorite thing to do.
Sarah did not have a car, so she needed to find a job that was close to her home and school. 
She was still going to school, so she needed to find a job that was flexible. 
She walked around the restaurants and stores in her neighborhood. 
Some were hiring, others had all their positions filled up. 
She applied to 10 different places. 
Her top choice was her favorite frozen yogurt shop. 
They usually asked for a resume, a cover letter, and an application. 
She was excited to continue with her job search.

They were a movie theater, a yogurt shop, a candy shop, a video game store, and a coffee shop. 
She did not mind any of the jobs. 
They all seemed suitable for her schedule.
