1. THE HAIRSTYLE CHANGE

A different hairstyle or color can change a person's entire look. 
It can make a person look better or worse. 
Jean was about to enter her first day of college. 
She wanted a new look. 
Her current hairstyle was nice, but it was boring. 
She had it since she was a 9th grader. 
Her hair right now was straight, long, and blonde.
She went into the hair salon and asked for the hairstylist. 
"What kind of look are you going for?" the hairstylist asked. 
"I want to look like a model," Jean said. 
"Well, we can add layers to your hair. 
We can also make your hair more blonde," the hairstylist said. 
"That sounds good!" Jean said. 
Jean sat in the chair while the hairstylist cut her hair. 
Jean couldn't see herself in the mirror because she didn't have her glasses on. 
She just trusted the hairstylist. 
An hour later, the hairstylist said, "Done!" Jean put on her glasses and looked at herself. 
She looked totally different! 
She liked it, but felt strange. 
She could barely even recognize herself.
Jean asked her friends and family what they thought. 
Most of them liked it. 
They said it made her look edgier, but very different. 
In fact, when she met up with her friends, they asked who she was. 
One of them even tried calling the police when Jean showed up in front of her house.
When Jean was shopping with her friends at the mall, a model scout came up to her and asked if she would consider modeling. 
Jean said she would think about it and took his business card. 
The new hairstyle was really working out for her.

2. TOO OLD FOR TRICK-OR-TREATING

Kelly's favorite holiday is Halloween. 
She loved pumpkin pie, pumpkin spice latte, dressing up, scary movies, and trick-or-treating. 
The sad thing, however, is that Kelly knows that she is too old for trick-or-treating. 
She is now 21 years old. 
She loved how she could get different kinds of candy for free.
This Halloween, Kelly was going to babysit her 10 year-old cousin Albert and his friends. 
Kelly dressed up as a pirate. 
Her cousin and his friends dressed as ghosts. 
Albert and his friends made Halloween themed cupcakes. 
The frosting was orange and the sprinkles on top were black. 
Afterwards, they carved pumpkins. 
Albert asked, "What should we do now, Kelly?" "Why don't you go trick-or-treating?" she suggested. 
"I'm too scared to talk to strangers," Albert said. 
"Don't worry, I will go with you!" Kelly said.
All of them went to the house to the right. 
They knocked on the door and said "Trick-or-treat!" 
The couple smiled and gave the kids a chocolate bar. 
Kelly wished they gave her one. 
They went to the next house and the family there gave them gummy worms. 
The next house they went to was interesting. 
The couple there gave them money! 
Kelly definitely wanted some money.
They went to a total of 10 houses and got more than 10 different types of candy. 
They all went back to Kelly's house. 
Kelly was sad looking at all their candy. 
Then, Albert and his friends gave Kelly a hug and said they loved hanging out with her.

3. THE NIGHT SHIFT

Ophelia was a night shift worker at a hospital. 
This meant that she worked late at night. 
Ophelia's work schedule was 9 p.m. to 4 a.m. 
Ophelia would sleep during the day while most people were at work. 
For the first year of work, Ophelia had a hard time adjusting to the schedule. 
She had trouble sleeping during the afternoon. 
She was upset that she had to miss out on social events her friends hosted.
It's still hard for Ophelia to adjust, but she is better at it. 
When she comes back from work, she goes to the gym for a few hours. 
Then, she practices her knitting skills. 
Afterwards, she would make herself a healthy meal. 
Night shift workers often eat unhealthier than day shift workers. 
After lunch, she would watch her favorite TV show. 
After that, she would sleep.
The hospital informed the employees that they could send requests to change the time of their shift. 
Ophelia was excited about this and immediately sent in a request to change her shift. 
A couple of weeks later, the manager gave Ophelia a letter. 
The letter stated that her request was rejected.
Ophelia was shocked. 
She went to her manager and asked him why. 
He said that many night shift workers who requested an earlier shift were elderly. 
Ophelia was only 25. 
The manager thought that the older employees needed an earlier shift more than Ophelia did.
Ophelia was mad at first, but she thought about the older employees. 
Their bones were aching and they're tired. 
They do need it more than her.
