1. THE HAIRSTYLE CHANGE

A different hairstyle or color can change a person's entire look. 
It can make a person look better or worse. 
Jean was about to enter her first day of college. 
She wanted a new look. 
Her current hairstyle was nice, but it was boring. 
She had it since she was a 9th grader. 
Her hair right now was straight, long, and blonde.
She went into the hair salon and asked for the hairstylist. 
"What kind of look are you going for?" the hairstylist asked. 
"I want to look like a model," Jean said. 
"Well, we can add layers to your hair. 
We can also make your hair more blonde," the hairstylist said. 
"That sounds good!" Jean said. 
Jean sat in the chair while the hairstylist cut her hair. 
Jean couldn't see herself in the mirror because she didn't have her glasses on. 
She just trusted the hairstylist. 
An hour later, the hairstylist said, "Done!" Jean put on her glasses and looked at herself. 
She looked totally different! 
She liked it, but felt strange. 
She could barely even recognize herself.
Jean asked her friends and family what they thought. 
Most of them liked it. 
They said it made her look edgier, but very different. 
In fact, when she met up with her friends, they asked who she was. 
One of them even tried calling the police when Jean showed up in front of her house.
When Jean was shopping with her friends at the mall, a model scout came up to her and asked if she would consider modeling. 
Jean said she would think about it and took his business card. 
The new hairstyle was really working out for her.

"I'm too scared to talk to strangers," Albert said. 
"Don't worry, I will go with you!" Kelly said.
All of them went to the house to the right.

A couple of weeks later, the manager gave Ophelia a letter. 
The letter stated that her request was rejected.
Ophelia was shocked. 
She went to her manager and asked him why. 
He said that many night shift workers who requested an earlier shift were elderly. 
Ophelia was only 25. 
The manager thought that the older employees needed an earlier shift more than Ophelia did.
Ophelia was mad at first, but she thought about the older employees. 
Their bones were aching and they're tired.

Every day Tiffany jogged 5 miles around her house. 
She loved running around her neighborhood. 
It made her feel refreshed for the rest of the day. 
She felt more healthy and productive after her runs. 
She did not always run the same route. 
She liked to change her route to make running more fun. 
Sometimes she ran to grocery stores and sometimes she ran to her friend's house. 
It was a new journey each time.
In order to run, she had to have the right gear. 
She always wore quality athletic clothes. 
She had to wear good running shoes that were durable. 
She kept her hair in a high ponytail so her hair would not interfere with her face. 
She kept a water bottle with her at all times to continue to stay hydrated.
Sometimes she ran at the gym, but she preferred the fresh air. 
There was something about seeing the trees and cars passing by, which made her happy.
She always listened to music when she ran.

23. A LONELY PUPPY

Rebecca was going on her daily jog when she saw a lonely puppy on the sidewalk. 
The puppy was alone. 
She did not see its owner anywhere in sight. 
The puppy had a collar. 
She checked the collar for an address or identification, but there was none. 
The puppy followed her and began to play with her. 
The puppy seemed to really like Rebecca. 
Rebecca loved dogs and did not mind at all. 
She wanted to help this puppy find its owner. 
She did not want to just abandon him.
She decided to take a picture of the dog and post fliers around her town. 
She hoped that the puppy was local to the area. 
For the time being, she took the puppy home. 
She bought dog food and prepared a nice area for the puppy to sleep. 
The puppy seemed confused in its new environment. 
It was a little shy, but still showed a liking to Rebecca.
The next day, Rebecca posted fliers all over town. 
She added her phone number in case anyone wanted to contact her about the dog. 
She hoped that she could find its owner. 
She decided to take the dog for a walk. 
She started to form a connection with the dog, but she knew she could not keep him.
A few hours later, a woman contacted her about the dog. 
She was so relieved Rebecca had found him. 
Rebecca returned the puppy to the woman and could see how happy both of them were. 
Rebecca felt great and decided she would get a puppy in the future.

Someone had knocked down the family's vase. 
The mom was furious. 
She had treasured that vase and was upset that it was now broken. 
She did not know who broke it since she was not home that day. 
The only two people who were home were her daughter Violet and son Harry. 
She asked them who broke the vase. 
Both of them were quiet. 
They refused to answer, in fear of getting in trouble.
She threatened to punish both of them if they did not give her an answer. 
They began to blame each other. 
They began to yell and tell their stories at the same time. 
She told each to explain their sides. 
Violet explained that they were playing tag and Harry tagged her while pushing her at the same time causing her to knock the vase over. 
Harry explained that Violet tried to dodge his tag and hit the vase. 
There was no way for the mom to tell who was actually right.
The mom decided it was an innocent mistake. 
She did not punish either of them. 
She just told them not to play tag in the house anymore. 
Harry and Violet had to be more careful next time. 
They apologized to their mom. 
They both felt terrible for upsetting her. 
They decided to be super good and started cleaning up the house.

I have been in the same math class as Eric for a few months now.

He is extremely nice and funny. 
One day, I decided to ask Eric if he wanted to go out with me to the mall. 
I was so happy when he said yes. 
I was excited; this would be my first date. 
I was also nervous since I had never been on a date. 
I did not know what to do or how to act. 
I hoped I would figure it out.
I planned our date to the minute. 
I wanted to be prepared and know exactly what to do. 
We were going to the mall on Saturday at noon. 
He was going to pick me up and drive to the mall, where we would get food, and then shop at our favorite stores.
However, when the day came, everything went wrong. 
First of all, I could not find my favorite outfit that I had planned on wearing. 
I settled for a clean plain t-shirt and some jeans. 
He was also late because his car got a flat tire on the way to my house. 
I was scared about what else could go wrong. 
He apologized about being late, and I forgave him.
We talked in the car and played music as we drove. 
We had a good conversation about school, traveling, and family. 
He was easy to talk to. 
I was so relieved. 
The date ended up being really fun. 
We had a good time eating and shopping at the mall.

She was excited to begin her Do-It-Yourself project. 
She looked up a bunch of tutorials and videos on arts and crafts. 
There were many easy projects. 
She could make the decoration on her own instead of having to buy it at a store, which would save her money and also allow her to customize her decorations.

28. MICHELLE'S NEW LOOK

Michelle was tired of how her hair looked. 
She always kept it in a high ponytail. 
She had long brown hair, which had been her hairstyle for her whole life. 
She did not hate it, but she wanted to make a change. 
She thought this was the perfect time to change her hair. 
She thought about what she could do.
She could change the color of her hair. 
Michelle was open to dying it black or a lighter brown. 
She did not want anything too colorful and attention catching. 
She settled on dying it a lighter brown. 
Michelle also wanted to get highlights instead of dying all her hair. 
She thought that would make it look more interesting.
Another option Michelle had was to cut her hair. 
Since she always had long hair, she thought about cutting her hair short. 
She decided she would cut her hair and donate her hair. 
Her hair was long enough to donate. 
Her hair had also never been dyed, so she had extremely healthy hair. 
Michelle was excited for her new look. 
She looked up pictures for reference to show the hair stylist.

30. THE JOB SEARCH

Sarah wanted to get a job to save up money for her future. 
She did not want to keep asking her parents for money. 
She thought getting a job would be a good way to build her experience. 
Since she never had a job before, she decided to start with a simple part-time job. 
There were a lot of options out there. 
She could be a cashier, a tutor, a waitress, or an usher. 
She decided that a cashier job would be most suitable for her. 
This was a job that seemed simple enough that she could learn. 
It would also let her interact with people, which is her favorite thing to do.
Sarah did not have a car, so she needed to find a job that was close to her home and school. 
She was still going to school, so she needed to find a job that was flexible. 
She walked around the restaurants and stores in her neighborhood.

Roberto had certainly thought about it before. 
The truth was, it just seemed too much even for him. 
The Extreme Burger included 10 beef patties, chicken strips, hot dogs, chicken wings, mozzarella sticks, french fries, and much more. 
Roberto could probably eat half of that, but not the whole thing.
"Come on, Roberto! Do it! Are you scared?" his friend teased. 
Whenever someone told Roberto he could not do something, he had to prove them wrong. 
Roberto called over the waiter and asked for the Extreme Burger. 
Everyone at the restaurant surrounded Roberto. 
He felt nervous. "In 3-2-1 go!" the waiter said.

Dairy products include milk, ice cream, cheese, and yogurt. 
Rose hates that she cannot eat ice cream without getting a stomachache. 
It is something she has to deal with, though. 
She is okay with not eating things like cheese and milk.

34. FINANCIAL AID

Pamela got accepted to Harvard University! 
Her family and friends were excited for her. 
Harvard was known for being hard to get into. 
Even if you got straight As in high school, you could get rejected. 
You have to also be very involved in school, do volunteer work, and write well. 
Pamela immediately knew that she wanted to go to Harvard, but she was worried about money. 
Harvard was a private school, so it was expensive.
Two weeks later, she got an email from Harvard telling her what she got for financial aid. 
Pamela did not get as much aid as she hoped for. 
There are two types of financial aid: grants and loans. 
Grants are good because it is money given to you from the school that you do not have to pay back. 
For loans, you have to pay it back eventually. 
Harvard offered Pamela a lot of loans but not much grants. 
Pamela told her parents that she would not go to Harvard. 
Her parents told her that she should still go. 
Harvard was a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.
After some thinking, Pamela agreed. 
She decided that she was going to apply for scholarships. 
She went to her school's college center and found several scholarships she was qualified for. 
She applied to a scholarship for history majors, one for violinists, one for Filipino-Americans, and one for female students. 
In the end, she managed to get $3000 from scholarships. 
This was a good start. She would get a job at Harvard while she took classes.

35. NEW YEAR RESOLUTIONS

Before a new year, people make resolutions. 
Resolutions are things you want to change about yourself or things you want to happen. 
Common New Year resolutions include losing weight, getting good grades, spending less, and traveling more. 
It is hard to achieve resolutions because we can fall back into our old habits easily and make excuses.
In December, gyms are almost empty. 
People are sitting comfortably at home eating. 
Once it hits the new year, gyms are crowded with people hoping to lose weight. 
Sadly, people will start losing hope and get lazy. 
It is easy to eat unhealthy food and not exercise. 
Well, it takes a lot of willpower to stay healthy for a long period of time. 
Kathleen's resolution is to lose weight. 
She currently weighs 150 pounds at 5'4". 
She wants to lose thirty pounds by the end of the year.
Kathleen bought a year-long gym membership. 
She decided to buy it for the entire year instead of month by month as a way to stop herself from canceling. 
It costs $200 for a whole year. 
The gym has everything she needs. 
There is even a spa in the gym. 
Kathleen went to the gym every day for two weeks. 
After two weeks, however, Kathleen had to go back to school. 
She had less time to go to the gym. 
Even when she did have time, she did not go because she was tired from class. 
She still managed to go to the gym twice a week though.

Vanessa had been eyeing a dress online for a long time. 
It was a long, white crochet dress, which cost $100. 
She was hoping the price would go down. 
She checked the website every day for one month, but the price never went down. 
She wanted the dress in the medium size. 
The website said there were only five more left. 
She did not want it to sell out. 
She finally bought the dress.
A week later, it came to her house. 
Vanessa excitedly opened the package and the dress was perfect. 
It looked exactly the way it did on the website! 
Her cousin was throwing a party on a yacht that night. 
Vanessa wanted to wear the dress for that party.
When Vanessa arrived, everyone complimented on how she looked. 
The dress was definitely worth it. 
"Where did you get that dress?" her cousin asked. 
"tula.com," Vanessa said. 
Her cousin went on the website. 
There were only two more in the size medium and one more in the size small.
The next day, Vanessa decided to wear the same dress at her friend's dinner party. 
"Hey Vanessa! Nice dress. I just bought the same one today. It was such a good price," Jan said. 
"You mean you don't think $100 is a good price?" Vanessa said. 
"Oh no, it was only $35!" Jan said. 
Vanessa's jaw dropped. 
If only she waited one day.

38. A WASTE OF WATER

Most people shower once every day. 
Joyce thinks this is a waste of water. 
She showers every other day. 
Joyce does not mind if people know that she does not shower daily. 
She tells people that showering every day is a waste of water. 
There are so many countries that do not have clean water readily available. 
There is also a drought in California. 
Joyce believes that people should only shower if they really have to. 
For example, if someone just finished going to the gym, they should shower.
Joyce's entire family only showers once every other day. 
One day, Joyce invited her classmates to her house to work on their project. 
The project was on water usage. 
Joyce revealed that she and her entire family do not shower daily. 
Her classmates looked at her in disgust and then pinched their noses. 
"You guys don't even smell anything. If I did not tell you, you would not be doing that," Joyce said. 
They all made excuses to leave her house.
Joyce was disappointed in them. 
She thought they were being immature. 
She decided to do the project by herself. 
Joyce presented her project in front of the entire class. 
It was on showering daily and how scientists have proved that it was not necessary. 
The teacher was impressed and gave Joyce an A+. 
Her classmates ended up doing not so well. 
They also got in trouble for leaving Joyce to do the project by herself alone.

39. AN ICE CREAM ACCIDENT

Cynthia and her friends were walking in the mall like they always do. 
They did this twice a month after the last class on Friday. 
Cynthia's favorite shop was actually the bookstore. 
Some of her friends liked shopping for clothes and some of her friends liked the food at the mall. 
"Look! Cynthia, your favorite singer is in Forever 21," said Martha. 
Cynthia turned around. 
When she was turning around, she knocked an ice cream cone out of a woman's hand and it landed on the woman's shirt. 
The woman was upset.
Cynthia apologized and started taking the ice cream off the woman's shirt. 
The woman was even more upset. 
"How dare you touch me!" she said. 
Cynthia apologized again. 
"You're going to have to pay for this shirt and the ice cream!" the woman said. 
Cynthia's friends started laughing. 
They thought it was funny that she was making a big deal out of the situation. 
"Can't you just put the shirt in the washing machine? Why does she have to pay for your shirt?" asked Martha. 
"The stain is not going to come off," the woman said. 
"It's alright, Martha. I'll just pay for it," Cynthia said.
Cynthia asked the woman how much the shirt was. 
"It was $147," she said. 
Cynthia reached into her wallet. 
"Cynthia, this woman is clearly lying to you," Martha said. 
Cynthia thought about it. 
Martha was probably right! 
This woman was taking advantage of Cynthia's kindness. 
Cynthia asked for proof and the woman could not give it to her. 
The woman walked away, embarrassed that she was caught lying. 
Cynthia was thankful for Martha.

40. A PAIR OF MAGI-PANTS

Peggy was watching TV one day It was Monday afternoon, so there was nothing good on. 
It was mostly just local news, soap opera, or paid programming. 
Peggy decided to watch the paid programming channel. 
The product they were trying to sell was Magi-pants. 
According to the sellers, Magi-pants made your legs look smaller. 
They came in multiple colors. 
The TV showed satisfied customers talking about Magi-pants. 
One of them even said that she gained confidence after wearing the pants.
Peggy usually made fun of the people on paid programming. 
This time, however, she wanted to buy the product. 
Peggy never liked her legs. 
No matter how much she exercised or diet, her legs would still be big. 
Magi-pants was also having a deal, too. 
Buy one pair, get the second one half off. 
If she called within ten minutes, she could get a free pair of MagiShorts. 
Peggy called the number. 
She ordered one pair.
A week later, the pants arrived in the mail. 
Peggy tore the package and tried them right away. 
She looked in the mirror, but did not see the difference. 
Frustrated, she called the company asking for a refund. 
"Miss, are you sure you don't see the difference?" 
"Yes, I am sure," Peggy said. 
The sales representative tried to offer her another pair of pants, but Peggy declined. 
That was the first and last time she ordered anything from paid programming.

Melanie said yes. 
When Melanie arrived at his house, she asked why he lied to her earlier. 
Paul sighed. 
"The truth is, I don't want people to know we are dating," he said. 
"Why not?" Melanie asked. 
"My friends don't have the best opinion of you," he said. 
"What?! What do they think about me?" she asked. 
"They just think you're kind of weird and too talkative," he said. 
"So you are embarrassed to be seen with me?" she asked. 
"Don't say it like that," Paul said.
The next day Melanie went up to Paul and his friends. 
"Just so you know, Paul and I are dating," she said.

42. THE SCHOOL DRESS CODE

Liberty High School decided to enforce a dress code. 
Up until now everyone could wear whatever they wanted. 
Students started taking advantage of this. 
Boys were sagging their pants and wearing shirts with bad words on them. 
Girls were showing their belly button and wearing shorts that were too short. 
The principal made the announcement about the dress code in the auditorium. 
All the students were upset. 
"This is ridiculous!" someone yelled. 
"Quiet down or else you will get detention," Principal Baker said.
Principal Baker showed the students the uniform. 
The girls had to wear a white collared shirt with a red skirt. 
The boys had to wear a white polo shirt with red slacks. 
The boys and girls had to wear the same white shoes, too. 
The students were disgusted. 
"If you have long hair, you need to wear your hair up," the Principal said. 
The girls were furious. 
"Piercings and tattoos are not allowed either," Principal Baker added. 
"What if we already have a tattoo? I can't remove it!" a student shouted. 
"That is fine. Just do your best to hide it," Principal Baker said.

Principal Baker thought everyone would be in uniform the next day. 
Instead, everyone was protesting!

43. TO BE INDEPENDENT

Beverly has been in boarding school since she was ten years old. 
Her parents put her in boarding school to make her a more independent person. 
Beverly was against it at first. 
She wanted to stay with her parents like most kids of her age. 
She started getting used to boarding school when she was about 15 years old. 
She would only see her parents during winter break and during the summer.
Beverly is okay with it now, because she is so used to not seeing her parents. 
Whenever she sees her parents though, they spend almost every day together. 
However, Beverly is going to attend a university near her parents. 
In fact, the university is only 20 minutes away from their house. 
Beverly asked if they wanted her to stay with them. 
Her parents said that she should live in the dorms to make more friends. 
Beverly agreed. 
Even though Beverly lived close to her parents, she barely saw them because she was so busy. 
She did see them during winter break though.
Beverly wanted to study abroad in the summer in Italy. 
She asked her parents if they were okay with that. 
"Absolutely not! Being alone in a different country is dangerous!" her mom said. 
"But I have been alone for so long! Isn't this why you put me in boarding school to begin with? I know how to be independent. I am responsible and smart enough to go to Italy alone," she said. 
"Honey, the truth is, we just wanted to spend summer with you," her dad said. 
That is when Beverly realized that even though her parents wanted her to be independent, they cherished spending time with her a lot.
