1. LEAVING FOR WORK
At precisely 6 a.m., the sound of the alarm clock pierces the air. 
Sandy drags herself out of bed and begins her morning routine with a quick shower. 
After her shower, she prepares a simple breakfast. 
Grabbing a clean bowl from the dishwasher, she empties into it a packet of instant oatmeal. 
She pours in a cup of milk, stirs and heats the mixture in the microwave. 
While waiting for her oatmeal to cook, she dresses for the day, mindful of the weather.
Fully dressed now, she removes her oatmeal from the microwave, which has now cooled just enough to suit her taste. 
It is her favorite flavor, apple cinnamon. 
As she savors each bite, she is reminded of her mother, who always made sure Sandy ate a warm breakfast before leaving the house in the morning.
Checking the time on her phone, she hurriedly swallows the last few mouthful of oatmeal before heading out. 
As she steps into the street, a gust of wind blows back her hair. 
She covers her head with the hood of her coat, tightens the scarf around her neck, and braces for her walk to the train station.
After settling into her seat on the train, memories of her mother stir again. 
She takes out her phone and texts: "Hey mom, thanks for the scarf you knit me. It came in real handy this morning. Love always."

2. SHOPPING AT THE SUPERMARKET

Pulling into the parking lot of the largest supermarket in town, Joe could already see it was going to be a challenge to find parking on this Saturday morning. 
He decides to first drop off his wife Melissa, so she could get a head start on the shopping they need to do. 
Meanwhile, he battles to find a free spot amongst the crowd of other waiting cars.
Inside, Joe finally finds Melissa, whose cart already loaded with packages of organic snacks and drinks. 
He knows Melissa is easily tempted by fancy words that promise health benefits. 
It makes her feel good to know that she is making healthy decisions. In the past, Joe would try to reason with her, explaining that health is not about consuming specific items, and more about general lifestyle. 
Today, he decides to simply move on. As the chef in the family, Joe looks forward every week to the process of selecting meats and vegetables, imagining all the ways he can flavor and cook them. Free samples are being offered at the familiar locations â€“ Melissa makes sure to hit up every station. They agree the chicken sausage is their favorite and buy two packs. 
The buy-one-get-one-free fresh pasta attracts Joe, while the sale on cheesecake draws Melissa.
As they wait in line to check out, Melissa examines their overflowing shopping cart and realizes that they are over budget. 
She puts back the snacks and drinks that were clearly impulse buys, and happily claims she is learning to be a great shopper! 
Joe can only smile at the expression on her face. 
Five months ago when they first got married, he never imagined he would enjoy these Saturday morning grocery trips. 
Now, he finds in them a peaceful satisfaction, a welcome change from his work all week.

----------------------------------------

3. SUNDAY AFTERNOONS

All week, Frank and Bob have been looking forward to Sunday afternoon. 
That is when their favorite football team, the Philadelphia Eagles, plays their first game of the season. 
The Eagles have a new coach, and many new, young, and talented players. 
Football can be a very unpredictable game, with weather, injuries, referees, and luck all affecting the outcome of the game. 
On top of that, new players and coaches may need some time to learn to work as a team.
For almost a decade now, Frank and Bob have watched Eagles games together. 
They met through work, but their friendship continues even though Frank left the company a few years back. 
Their wives have become close and sometimes even join them for the games. 
When their sons were still young, they used to be just as excited about these Sunday afternoons. 
Now in high school, they'd rather hang out with their friends than their fathers. 
Nonetheless, Frank and Bob have kept up their friendship and this tradition, and couldn't think of a better way to spend Sunday afternoons.
This week, they will be watching the game at Bob's house, who is anxious to show off the new sound system he installed in his basement. 
As Frank walks up the driveway, carrying a pack of their favorite beer, Bob walks out to meet him, already dressed in Eagle's uniform. 
After some playful punching, they come together for a quick embrace. 
Once inside, they are greeted by the familiar sounds of the pre-game show. 
It's going to be a great season!

4. JULIE JOINS FACEBOOK

Julie was sitting in bed late at night playing with her brand-new smartphone. 
Earlier that week, she had been visited by her children and grandchildren to celebrate her 70th birthday, and had received the phone as a gift from her granddaughter Mary. 
Julie had been widowed for five years now. 
Since she lived hours away from the rest of the family, Mary thought the phone would be a good way for them to keep in touch and take up some of her time.
Up until then, Julie had never really been interested in catching up with modern technology, but finally owning her own smartphone made her feel youthful, and she decided to join Facebook since that was what she had noticed all the younger people were doing. 
However, when making her profile page, she was embarrassed to put up a picture of herself since she thought she looked much too wrinkly and nobody would want to talk to her. 
To remedy this, she downloaded a picture of a beautiful 20-something year old from Google, posted it under her name, and went to sleep.
The next morning, Julie woke up and enthusiastically logged into Facebook in hopes that she would have one or two new friends. 
She could not believe her eyes. 
Her inbox was full of friend requests from dozens and dozens of young handsome men that were complimenting her beauty and wanted to know all about her.
Julie decided to accept only the best-looking ones and began chatting with them day and night, never letting them know that they were actually talking to a grandma. 
The next time Julie met up with Mary, she thanked her so much for the phone and remarked, "I haven't felt so young and pretty in years!" Mary was confused and asked, "Why?" Julie just gave a mischievous smile and changed the topic.

----------------------------------------

5. BOWLING NIGHT

Jennifer loved going out to bowl every Tuesday night. 
She always liked bowling, but had never joined a bowling league until her friend Paul told her about a new league one day. 
The two friends enjoyed going to Lucky Lanes on weekends, but had to wait for the league games to finish before they could bowl. 
It did not bother them since they knew what time the league games were over. 
Paul talked to the manager of Lucky Lanes one day and discovered that a new league was forming soon. 
"That's great," said Paul. 
"I'm going to ask Jennifer if she wants to join, too," added Paul.
When Jennifer heard the news, she wasn't as excited as Paul thought she would be. 
"What's wrong, Jen?" asked Paul. 
"I just don't know if I'm good enough to play in a league," answered Jennifer. 
"Don't you have to be a good bowler to bowl in a league?" Paul thought about it for a while before going back to the manager to ask if the new league was for good bowlers, or anyone could join.
The manager told him that this new league was for beginners, and added that Paul and Jennifer would be some of the best players in the new league. 
Paul was very excited once again. 
When he told Jennifer what the manager had said, Jennifer's response was, "Where do I sign up?" This made Paul very happy.
Before long, the two friends were bowling away in their new team and league. 
The manager was right. 
Paul and Jennifer were among the best players. 
They both loved bowling in a league. 
They got to wear team bowling shirts and hats, and all the refreshments were included in the league fees. 
Soon they were knocking down pins. 
At the end of the season, their team won the trophy for coming in the first place!

----------------------------------------

6. THE HAUNTED WAREHOUSE

When William worked in Santa Fe Springs, California, back in the 90s, he told me he thought the building he worked at was haunted. 
"It really is," said William. 
"I have had more than a few incidents happen to me while I was working alone, late at night," he continued.
William was working as a manager for a very busy chemical distribution company at the time. 
In order to keep up with his work, he sometimes had to work at night, or go in on weekends to catch up with his paperwork.
William was a sensible man. 
He was not the type of person that would fly off the handle in troubling situations. 
He was always very calm, and composed. 
This is what made his story believable. 
I knew he wasn't the type to make things up.
One night, William went to work after dark and thought nothing of it. 
His former manager had told him that he might hear some weird noises coming from the warehouse, but it was only the 55-gallon drums expanding and contracting. 
During the heat of the day, the drums would expand, and at night, when it cooled off, the drums would contract, sometimes making a sound. 
William was not worried.
That night he was sitting at his desk when he heard what sounded like someone knocking on the door leading to the warehouse. 
William dismissed it as a drum "popping," and ignored it. 
A few moments later, the sound was back, and this time it was louder. 
Since there was no one else in the building, he became a bit nervous, but continued working. 
Soon the noises got louder and louder. 
The final straw was when he heard someone walking above the ceiling of his office. 
This scared him quite a bit, but again he ignored it. 
Finally, it happened again, and this time William ran into the warehouse to look above his office, but no one was there. 
After that, William never worked at night again.

----------------------------------------

7. MOVING TO ARIZONA

Jerry was seventeen when his family decided to move out their apartment in the city of Riverdale. 
They had lived there for nearly ten years. In those ten years, Jerry had made dozens of friends from around the city. 
He didn't understand why they had to move. 
Jerry wished he could stay behind while his family left to Arizona. 
He knew things weren't ever going to be the same if he left Riverdale, California.
"Why do we have to move?" Jerry would ask, sounding depressed. 
His parents had answered that question countless times already. 
Despite knowing the answer, Jerry was reluctant to believe it, so he kept asking. 
"Why do we have to move?" Jerry asked time after time. 
The simple truth was that Jerry and his family just could not afford to live in Riverdale any longer. 
It was hard for Jerry to accept that truth.
On the day before the move, Jerry walked around the familiar places in Riverdale. 
He walked passing the oak tree where he first kissed a girl. 
He walked past the corner mini-market where he would bring back milk every Sunday. 
He passed by his high school where he had learned and discovered his love of math and science.
Jerry knocked on the doors of friends' houses to say one final goodbye. 
"Good bye, Tom," Jerry told his best friend. 
"Goodbye Jane," Jerry told his girlfriend. 
The night fell when Jerry finally finished bidding his farewells to everybody he knew. 
"Goodbye, Riverdale," Jerry said, looking out his bedroom window as he went to sleep. 
That night, Jerry dreamed of moving to Arizona and making friends on the first day there. 
Everything in Arizona seemed great in his dream. 
The following morning when he awoke, Jerry no longer felt so bad about moving. 
"Everything is going to be all right," Jerry said to himself as he stepped into the moving van on his way to Arizona.

----------------------------------------

8. WORKING AT A BOOKSTORE

Joel had been working at a bookstore for four months. 
Although four months might seem like a long time, Joel felt like it had been only one month since he was hired. 
Working at a bookstore was a dream job for Joel. 
He couldn't believe he got hired on the day of his interview. 
Joel felt grateful to be working at where he was. 
He loved to brag all about his job to his friends and family.
Joel loved reading books on his spare time. 
His favorite author was Mark Twain. 
Joel's most beloved book of his was "The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn". 
Working at a bookstore not only gave Joel access to books, but allowed him to interact with other fellow book worms. 
Joel often would recommend books to customers, and customers would do the same for Joel. 
Every now and then, he would come across a classic book and take it for himself to read. 
Joel's manager allowed him one book for free once a week. 
It was difficult to decide which book to take sometimes.
Joel was getting paid three hundred dollars every two weeks. 
Sometimes he would surpass this amount when he worked overtime. 
After a couple of months, Joel had saved up enough money to finally purchase his first car. 
Buying a car was the main reason Joel wanted to start working. 
He began shopping online for used vehicles.
Joel already knew what kind of car he wanted. 
He had first seen a picture of it in a magazine, and since then, had dreamed of owning one of his very own. 
His dream car was 1984 BMW. 
Joel wanted a black one with two doors. 
He would search on the Internet until he finally found it. 
Joel could not believe when he discovered a seller with the car.

----------------------------------------

9. JOEL LEARNS TO DRIVE

Learning to drive seemed scary for Joel at first. 
He had recently purchased his first car, which was now sitting on his driveway, looking clean and shiny. 
The previous owner had maintained it for years and had spent a lot of money restoring it to its original condition. 
The car was a BMW, made in the year 1984. 
It was black and had only two doors. 
The interior was also black and had leather seating. 
The vehicle looked practically new to Joel, despite it being older than the new owner of it.
Joel was eager to start driving his new car. 
At 21, Joel had felt the need to be driving already. 
He was attending college in the city of Los Angeles, working at a bookstore in the city of Montebello, and living in the city of Bell. 
Having a car would make traveling much more convenient. 
Joel had been getting around by means of public transportation. 
He was ready to stop taking the bus to school and work.
The first thing Joel had to do was to go to DMV to register the car under his name. 
After that, he took a driving manual book from DMV to study for the written test. 
Passing the written test was the only way to get a driving permit. 
Joel studied for a few days, and passed his test. 
With the permit in hand, Joel next had to find someone to teach him how to drive.
Joel already knew who to ask for driving lessons. 
"If I'm going to teach you how to drive, you're going to have to commit 100 percent. Do you understand?" Joel's uncle asked him. 
"Yes, sir," responded Joel. 
After a month full of trial and error, Joel finally learned how to drive his car. 
Although it was scary at first, driving eventually became easy enough for Joel.

----------------------------------------

10. GHOST IN THE HALL

"Do you believe in ghost?" Alvin asked his brother Levi one night, as they were lying down in bed around eleven at night. 
"I don't think so," Levi replied. 
Alvin and Levi shared a room together. 
"Why not?" asked Alvin. 
"I have never seen one," Levi said. 
Alvin was twelve years old and Levi was eighteen. 
"I think I saw one, Levi," Alvin told his brother, sounding frightened. 
"Go to sleep, Alvin," Levi told his brother, as he turned around in his bed to face the closet. 
"There's no such thing as ghost," Levi said.
Alvin and Levi were lying on separate beds. 
Levi had fallen asleep half an hour ago, but Alvin was still awake. 
He was having a hard time trying to go to sleep. 
A sound was keeping him awake. 
It sounded like someone was walking out in the hallway, right outside his bedroom door. 
It was completely dark.
Alvin was curious to find out who was sauntering out in the hallway. 
Fifteen minutes had passed and the creaking hadn't stopped. 
Alvin slowly rose from his bed. 
He moved towards his door, taking one step every two seconds. 
When he finally reached his door, he put his hand on the doorknob and gradually began to turn it. 
The walking had not ceased.
"Alvin, what are you doing?" Levi said right before Alvin could open the door. 
"I think there's a ghost in the hallway," Alvin replied. 
Levi rose to his feet and went to the door. 
"I'll go with you." Levi said. 
The two opened the door together and popped their heads out the door to take a look. 
"You see, it was nothing," Levi said. 
Alvin and Levi went back to bed. 
Levi again fell asleep before Alvin. 
Alvin could not go to sleep. 
There was someone walking in the hallway.

----------------------------------------

11. BOBBY THE FAT BOY

Bobby loved to eat. 
He ate hamburgers, French fries, hot dogs, pizza, donuts, and ice-cream, just to name a few. 
No matter how much Bobby ate, he never got a stomachache. 
It is no surprise that Bobby weighs two hundred and fifty pounds. 
It might be surprising to know that Bobby is only fifteen years old. 
Bobby didn't care that he was big. 
He was content with how he looked and loved eating as much as he could.
Bobby liked to tell jokes to his friends. 
"Knock, knock," Bobby would say. 
"Who's there?" friends would ask. 
"Gorilla," Bobby replied. 
"Gorilla who?" they'd ask back. 
"Gorilla me a hamburger!" Bobby replied, delivering the punch line. 
The joke was in how the word gorilla sounded like grill. 
Bobby's joke always left people in stitches.
Even though Bobby was popular and friendly, he was still teased by some kids in school. 
Fat boy Bobby was the nick name the mean kids gave to Bobby. 
Whenever Bobby heard the nick name, he would reply with gusto, "sticks and stones may break my bones, but words can never hurt me." 
The bullies would funnily reply, "I bet you would eat those sticks and stones, fat boy Bobby!" and scurry off running.
Bobby did not let idiotic name calling bother him. 
He had more important things to think about, like what he was going to eat for dinner. 
Bobby knew that one day he would have to lose weight if he wished to live a longer life. 
Until that day came, Bobby would continue eating what he wanted and as much he wanted.

----------------------------------------

12. FIFTH GRADE DANCE COMPETITION (1)

Jenny is a fifth grader. 
She is considered one of the most popular girls in her class. 
She is very pretty, but that is not why she is considered popular. 
She is popular because she is known to be among the brightest in her class. 
She can do the most cartwheels in a row, but mostly, she has the talent to dance.
Last year, she entered the school's dance competition and won the first place. 
Her whole class was there to support her. 
Since that day, she has been the class attraction. 
This year, the school is holding another dance competition, but there has been a change in this year's competition. 
The competition has to be done in pairs.
Jenny's class was looking up to her with high expectations of her winning again this year. 
On the other hand, Jenny was unsure of this year's outcome. 
She wanted to enter the competition, but she had never danced with a partner before. 
She decided to ask some of the boys in her class to enter with her. 
They all said no to her because they did not know how to dance. 
Jenny was becoming hesitant about joining.
She finally decided to turn to one of her closest friends, Carl. 
Jenny and Carl had known each other since the first grade. 
Carl was reluctant to join at first because he also didn't know how to dance. 
Jenny insisted. 
He eventually agreed to join the competition. 
Jenny was happy and relieved.
However, she was still worried because she knew her class was counting on her to win this year's competition.
All she needed was some time and practice in order to increase her chances of winning. 
This time, it was going to be more of a challenge considering the fact that Carl was not a good dancer. 
The competition was in two months, and only time could predict her chances of winning.

----------------------------------------

13. FIFTH GRADE DANCE COMPETITION (2)

After selecting Carl as her partner, Jenny needed to start planning for the dance competition at her school. 
The competition started in two months. 
Jenny was aware that Carl was not a great dancer. 
She had to dedicate some time in helping him improve his skill. 
On the first few days of preparation, Jenny had planned out their dance routine, with the help of her teacher. 
They were going to be dancing to "Jailhouse Rock" by Elvis Presley.
Jenny and Carl spent the first two weeks memorizing their steps and cues to their dance. 
Carl was pretty clumsy at first. 
He eventually got the hang of it. 
They spent the rest of the time perfecting their moves. 
The day of the competition was almost near. 
Jenny and Carl were beginning to get nervous. 
They were going up against nine other pairs from the same school.
The day of the competition arrived. 
Carl had not become a great dancer, but had definitely improved since he began. 
Since Jenny won last year's competition, she was to perform with Carl last. 
The pairs that were performing this year were better dancers compared to last year's competition. 
As each pair took the stage one by one, Jenny grew more anxious. 
Carl noticed this from Jenny and told her, "It'll be okay, Jenny. You are great, and I'm sure we'll win." 
Jenny felt better after hearing Carl's words. 
Soon, it was their turn to perform. 
They walked on stage and began to dance as soon as their song started to play.
They were off to a great start. 
Jenny's class was there cheering them on. 
The crowd began cheering them on as well. 
Suddenly, Jenny tripped and fell. 
The crowd was shocked. 
Carl managed to get Jenny back up on time for their big finale. 
Jenny was upset because of her fall. 
After their performance, the judges tallied up the scores and were ready to announce the winner. 
Jenny and Carl won, but it was a close call. 
If it wasn't for Jenny's talent and Carl's quick thinking to keep the routine going, they wouldn't have won. 
They were both awarded with a trophy and medals. 
Jenny and Carl were full of cheer.

----------------------------------------

14. CAMPING TRIP

It is the first day of the summer. 
George and his friend Carlos are planning on going on a camping trip. 
It is going to be the best camping trip, which will last three days. 
While Carlos makes invitations for their friends, George is going to make a list of activities to do while they are there. 
Last year, their camping trip was not entirely a success. 
They got a flat tire on the way to their campsite. 
They also had a bear take some of their food. 
They don't want to encounter that again.
This year, they plan to go prepared. 
George is going to take a spare tire and gas, just in case they run out. 
Carlos is going to try and find a better method of storing food without attracting animals to their campsite. 
They don't want anything to ruin this year's trip. 
On this trip, George and Carlos have invited ten of their friends. 
Everyone is excited. 
George has prepared his list of activities to do with his friends.
They plan to go mountain climbing, hiking, kayaking, fishing, and to play a few games of flag football. 
For night activities, they plan to tell stories, sing songs along with George's guitar, and play some board games. 
Carlos and his friends have pitched in some money for food. 
With the list Carlos made, they are going to have food, vegetables, chicken, and fruit juice.
The day of the camping trip is getting near. 
George and Carlos cannot wait. 
When the day comes, George and Carlos double check to see if they have their things ready. 
At the last minute, George suddenly remembers that it is important to bring matches, lanterns, and flashlights. 
Carlos also suggests that they take binoculars for sightseeing. 
They are ready to go. 
It is going to be the best trip they have ever made.

15. PAINTING A MURAL

Anna woke up late one morning. 
She was supposed to meet up with a group of friends that morning at 8 o'clock. 
She woke up at 8:15 instead. 
Anna rushed to get ready. 
She quickly showered, put on her clothes. 
Then, she grabbed her tool box and headed out on her bike.
Anna and her friends were asked to paint two murals for the city's library. 
One of the murals was to be located on the outside, and the other on the inside. 
The owner of the library was the one who requested these murals. 
The reason was because he was a fan of Anna's art, and was planning to remodel the library.
Both murals were going to be painted with a similar theme. 
They were both going to be paintings aimed to inspire people to read. 
Anna already had her ideas for both murals planned out. 
It was going to be colorful. 
Her friends were going be there to help paint the large areas of the mural.
Once Anna arrived, she noticed her friends waiting outside the library. 
Anna apologized for being late. 
She pulled out her ideas to show to her friends. 
Her friends were impressed and excited to begin painting. 
They first started by outlining the images of the ideas onto both walls. 
Next, they mixed their colors and began to paint. 
Painting the mural was a lot faster to do when you have the help of your friends. 
They finished both murals within two days.
The new murals attracted the attention of local visitors to the library. 
The owner of the library was impressed and happy with the new look of his library. 
He awarded Anna and her friends with recognition and paid them for their labor. 
Anna was pleased.

16. NEW YORK, NEW YORK

Two years ago, Amy left her small hometown in England and moved to one of the biggest cities in the United States -- New York. 
Amy knew the transition would be difficult at first, but was confident that she would love her new life and succeed in becoming a Broadway star. 
She had envisioned herself getting off the airplane and immediately making new friends with whom she would spend her nights exploring The City That Never Sleeps.
Unfortunately, the reality of Amy's situation was far from the perfect life she had imagined. 
Her days were spent jumping from theatre to theatre looking for auditions. 
Although she was very pretty, and great at acting, her accent made it difficult for her to get hired for any roles. 
Directors kept telling her to work on her American accent, but the more she practiced it, the more she sounded like a cowboy rather than a New Yorker.
Amy's nights were spent working at a diner in order to pay for her ridiculously expensive one-room apartment where the sinks always leaked and the hot water never worked. 
To top it all off, the city that she had imagined as being filled with bright lights and friendly faces like in the movies was made up mostly of smelly alleys, big rats, and angry crowds that were always in a hurry to get somewhere. 
Still, Amy didn't let anything crush her spirits, and was determined to keep working hard until her dreams would come true.
Finally one day, Amy was clearing some tables in the diner while singing her favorite song as usual. 
"Excuse me," said a man in a nearby booth. 
"I couldn't help but notice that you have a beautiful voice." Amy blushed and thanked the man. 
"I'm actually casting for a star in my new Broadway musical of Mary Poppins," he continued. 
"How would you feel about acting?" Amy's heart raced with excitement just as Frank Sinatra's "New York, New York" began playing on the diner's jukebox. 
She was finally going to make it.

----------------------------------------

17. NOT-SO-HAPPY MEALS

John is a busy lawyer, whose whole day revolves around two things: work and his two daughters. 
Balancing the two things often proves to be very difficult, so John spends most of his day in a rush to do everything he needs to do, and get everywhere he needs to be. 
With such a hectic schedule, it is common to find John and his children in line at a McDonald's drive-thru, waiting for some burgers, fries, and shakes.
"I know fast food isn't the healthiest thing I could give my daughters," admits John. 
"But it's the most convenient thing around when we're in a rush. Plus, it makes them happy." 
Unfortunately, this attitude towards the unhealthiness of fast food is one that so many parents in the U.S. hold, and it is easy to understand why.
Nowadays, nearly every single city in America is equipped with its own McDonald's. 
In Los Angeles alone, it can sometimes feel like there is one on every other corner when you're driving around. 
As if this didn't already make it hard enough for parents to avoid, McDonald's targets their famous "Happy Meals" to children so that every time they drive by the giant golden arches, children demand to go inside to get a new toy with their meal.
Although it may be very hard for parents to have healthier meal options for their children, doing so is a necessity that this country can no longer ignore.
Constantly consuming fast food is becoming a norm in American society and is resulting in millions of people suffering from obesity and diabetes for the rest of their lives.
Instead of teaching children that it is okay to give in to the temptation of a quick greasy meal, parents should get their children into the habit of healthy eating everywhere they go. 
In the end, children will be more thankful for living long, healthy, and happy lives, than for getting a cheap toy in a cardboard box.

----------------------------------------

18. THE BAD NEWS

David and Melissa had been a happily married couple for six years. 
They lived a comfortably modest life in a small apartment and had been saving up for years in preparation for the next giant step in their life: a baby.
However, after repeatedly trying to get pregnant for a whole year, they consulted a doctor and received devastating news. 
Melissa would be unable to conceive a child for the rest of her life.
The bad news struck Melissa terribly hard. 
Seeing his wife in such a distraught and depressed state broke David's heart. 
"Don't worry," he told her. 
"I'm going to make you the happiest woman in the planet, even if it's just the two of us." 
He then went to the bank, took out all their savings that had been held for the baby, and set out to do whatever he could to cheer his wife up.
Since they no longer had to be careful with how much money they spent, David began splurging on everything he could think of. 
First, he took Melissa shopping for the finest and most beautiful clothes she could dream of. 
Then, they took an exotic vacation to the Florida Keys, where they spent a month exploring every island and spending thousands of dollars on the most beautiful hotels, and most delicious foods they could find.
When they finally returned home. 
Melissa said, "Oh, David! Everything is perfect! I'm actually glad we don't have a child." 
David smiled, content with his wife's happiness, and walked over to check their voicemails from when they were away. 
The machine bleeped and then their doctor's voice came on saying, "Hi guys. Great news! There was a mistake in the test results. You are actually six weeks pregnant! It's Triplets."

----------------------------------------

19. THE BIG MOVE

Andrea's big day was finally here. 
She had been accepted into the medical school of her dream in Boston, and was about to fly there to begin her new life. 
She had gotten the news of her acceptance two months ago, but had spent all that time so busy preparing for the move that she hadn't had time to realize how nervous she really was. 
It wasn't until it was time for her to get up from the plane seat that she realized her legs were shaking, her heart was racing, and her forehead was sweating.
"Keep calm!" she kept repeating to herself the whole way to her new apartment. 
She had worked so hard to get here, and she knew that she had nothing to be afraid of. 
Still, as she looked out of her new living-room window, the world outside looked much too scary to face. 
Having grown up on the West Coast her whole life, she was not prepared for how everything looked here. 
The warm, bright sun that she was so used to seeing out this time of year was nowhere to be seen. 
Everyone's accents seemed completely unfamiliar, and the people even seemed taller than normal.
She decided to stay in the safety of her apartment that night and didn't go outside until it was time for her class the following afternoon. 
As the professor asked some basic questions to see what level everyone was at, Andrea's mind went completely blank. 
"Oh no!" she thought to herself. 
"I'm not even supposed to be here! Everyone knows so much more than me." 
Just then, the professor pointed at her and asked her a question about the functions of the spinal cord. 
As frightened as she was, the answer was just blurted out of her mouth instinctively. 
"Impressive!" says the teacher. 
"You'll do just great here." she assured her. 
As the teacher walked away, one of the pesky giant ants crawled across Andrea's desk. 
She quickly flicked it off the edge, and then smiled confidently.

20. THE DENTIST WILL SEE YOU NOW

Making an appointment to see the dentist is usually one of the smartest decisions a person could make for his or her health. 
However, for Marek, booking his dentist appointment ended up being one of the worst mistakes in his life. 
This was because of the fact that the dentist Marek chose to visit was his ex-girlfriend whom he had recently broken up with to be with another woman. 
This silly mistake resulted in Marek walking out of the dentist's office with all the 32 teeth missing.
"I didn't have any reason to doubt her," says Marek. 
"I mean I thought she was a professional". 
Quite on the contrary, his ex-girlfriend decided that this was the perfect chance to get her revenge for having been heart-broken. 
She gave him a heavy dose of anesthesia, pulled out all of his teeth, and bandaged his whole face up with gauze so that her work wouldn't be noticed until the bandages were all pulled off. 
"The bandages are to protect your gums," she told Marek, who then left the office, still heavily numbed by the effects of the anesthesia.
As the anesthesia wore off on his way home, he could tell something was terribly wrong because he couldn't feel any teeth. 
One can only imagine the panic he must have felt after uncovering his ex's work under all the gauze. 
After reporting the event to the police, his ex is now facing the possibility of three years in prison for a doctor's malpractice suit. 
On the bright side for her, she might be spending those three years behind bars pleased at knowing that her shocking stunt was very effective in terms of getting even with Marek. 
After seeing that he no longer had any teeth, his new girlfriend broke up with him.

21. THE LOTTERY TICKET

An 85-year-old woman in Tennessee named Astrid became a multimillionaire overnight after winning a $500 million lottery jackpot. 
However, her road to richness was not all completely smooth. 
Her story reminds us that in order to win the lottery, there are two crucial requirements. 
The first and most obvious necessity is a lot of luck. 
The second requirement is just as important, but much less often mentioned -- getting organized.
Astrid's story began when getting in line for a lottery ticket at her local supermarket. 
The woman ahead of her decided to let her cut in front of her to pay. 
This woman was also planning on buying a lottery ticket. 
Had she not given Astrid her spot in the line, the lottery money would have been hers!
On the day that the winners were announced, Astrid realized she had won, she could not contain her excitement. 
She danced with joy all around her house and jumped on the phone to tell her closest relatives what had just happened. 
The next morning Astrid woke up and prepared to go claim her prize money, but suddenly realized that she could not remember where she had placed her ticket. 
Given that her memory was no longer as sharp as it used to be, she searched and searched around her messy house for hours to no avail. 
She had absolutely no recollection of where she might have stored or dropped the ticket.
Astrid had been given thirty days to claim her prize, or else it would be canceled. 
For 27 days, her schedule was dedicated to searching every surface and square foot of her house for the missing ticket. 
With only three days left, she decided to finally call her daughters for help. 
She had been too embarrassed to call them from the beginning because her house was so messy, but now had no other choice. 
Figuring that helping their mother find the ticket would probably secure at least an extra million dollars to them, all three of Astrid's daughters immediately sped over to her house.
Within the first half hour of searching, the youngest of her daughters hollered, "I found it!" It turned out Astrid had left it in a dish cabinet. 
"Oh, thank you, daughter!" Astrid cried. 
"I owe you so much!" Her daughter's smile glistened with pride as her two sisters scowled at her from the next room.

22. A NEW "ALARM CLOCK"

For most people, an ideal morning might consist of waking up to the warm sun creeping in through the bedroom window, along with the cheerful chirping of the birds from a nearby tree. 
Sadly, this is not the case for Michael, a part-time student that works late nights as a warehouse manager. 
Michael gets home around 2:00 a.m. every night, and heads straight to bed to get as much sleep as possible until his classes start at 10:00 a.m. 
However, for the past week, Michael has had a new "alarm clock" that he unfortunately has no control of. 
It is an energetic, loud, mockingbird that has decided to make the tree outside of Michael's window his new home.
Each morning, the bird begins singing as loud as possible at exactly 5:55 a.m. and does not stop until late into the night. 
Most city birds begin the day with sweet, gentle chirps that can barely even be heard indoors, but the sounds of mockingbirds are very distinct and consist of various noises that the mockingbird hears and then imitates. 
This can include chirps from other birds, or even car alarms and school bells.
After one week of losing sleep as a result of the bird noises, Michael decided to do something. 
"Go away!" he screamed out his window. 
When that didn't work, he started throwing things at the tree to try to scare the bird away. 
This only made the bird get even louder! 
As a final resort, Michael phoned his local Animal Control, and requested to get someone to remove the bird from the area. 
"We can't do that," replied the Animal Control Specialist. 
"Mockingbirds are a valued feature of North America's wildlife and are protected by many laws. 
You should consider yourself lucky to have one so close to home. 
Just enjoy the beautiful sounds of nature."
Furious, Michael hung up the phone, and threw himself on the couch, dozing off into the deepest sleep he had ever experienced all week. 
Only five minutes later he awoke to a thunderous "caw-caw!" coming from outside.

23. THE UNLIKELY REUNION

On December 26, 2004, a 10-minute long earthquake with a 9.3 magnitude occurred in the Indian Ocean. 
This massive earthquake, which is the third strongest ever recorded in history, triggered various powerful tsunamis that reached over a dozen countries' shores. 
Nearly 230,000 people were killed by the catastrophe, and hundreds of thousands of others ended up injured or missing. 
In the midst of all the devastation caused by this disaster, many amazing and inspiring survival stories have emerged. 
One of the most extraordinary of these is the story of a young girl named Wati.
The tsunami struck her hometown of Aceh when she was only eight years old. 
Like so many others, the powerful waves separated her from her family, and she ended up being washed into an unknown town. 
After many years of searching for her, her family gave up and assumed she had died after being swept away. 
Miraculously, Wati was returned to her parents seven years later, at the age of 15!
According to Wati, she had been "adopted" by a stranger who found her on the streets after the tsunami. 
Although the woman took her in to live with her, she forced Wati to beg on the streets and would often beat her if she did not make enough money. 
The girl had tried to find her family by asking for help from strangers, but did not remember the names of her parents and could only vaguely remember that she had a grandfather named Ibraham.
Finally one day, a cab driver who heard Wati's story happened to know an old man with that name in a nearby town and decided to take her to him. 
Although the old man did not recognize her at first, he took Wati to see his daughter. 
"When I saw my mother, I knew it was her," said the 15-year-old. 
"I just knew." 
The parents were able to confirm that it really was their daughter based on a scar and birthmark on the girl's hip. 
This miraculous story is unfortunately one of the only confirmed reunions among families that were separated by the disaster.

24. THRIFT STORE TREASURES

It was Saturday morning. 
Mary walked out of her house with twenty dollars in her pocket and a spirit full of optimism. 
She had spent the previous night in front of her television set watching a reality show that followed lucky people who had found amazing things at their local thrift shops. 
All of these people had bought seemingly ordinary items for extremely low prices, and ended up discovering that their items were actually very valuable treasures. 
After having spent five consecutive hours watching other people's experiences, Mary was determined to give bargain hunting a try in hopes of finding something that would make her rich.
One of her favorite stories from the show was of a man who had purchased a copy of the Declaration of Independence thinking that it was a cheap replica, for only $2. 
He ended up discovering that the print was actually one of only 200 official copies of the Declaration of Independence commissioned by John Quincy Adams in 1820. 
The man ended up making $477,650 after selling it.
As Mary walked into her local thrift shop, she tried recalling what all the people in the reality show had looked for. 
The most common items that people got rich from were paintings and so she headed straight to the Home Decorations aisle. 
Once there, she couldn't decide which looked most expensive. 
They actually all seemed pretty ugly to her. 
"Excuse me," Mary said to an elderly woman walking by. 
"Which painting do you think could make me richer?" Confused, the old lady quickly pointed at one and walked away.
The painting the old lady had pointed at was of a cat collage with almost 20 different cat faces jumbled atop of one another. 
"Definitely not my first choice," thought Mary. 
However, she trusted destiny's decision and bought the painting for five dollars. 
After putting it up online, she began receiving dozens of emails asking if the picture frame displayed came with the painting. 
In order to see what all the buzz about the frame was about, she took it to an antique store and asked if there was anything special about the frame. 
"Of course, it is special!" remarked the clerk at the store. 
"Its wood and age make it at least $25,000!" Mary ended up selling the frame for $30,000. 
A few days later, the buyer returned the ugly painting to her through the mail.

25. WINTER TIME

Winter was approaching. 
Jason was excited for the coming season. 
It was his favorite time of a year. 
He loved the cold weather and snow. 
Jason lived in New York. 
During winter it would snow in New York. 
He always played in the snow, even as an adult. 
Jason would gather his family and friends at the park, where they had snowball fights. 
It was a lot of fun.
His favorite holiday Christmas occurred in winter. 
This was another reason why winter was Jason's favorite season. 
Every year, he bought presents for his friends and family. 
Jason loved seeing the look on their faces when they unwrapped their Christmas presents. 
It was better to give than to receive, Jason thought. 
Jason loved everything about Christmas. 
He enjoyed caroling. 
He loved singing Christmas music. 
He loved kissing his wife under the mistletoe. 
He loved drinking sweet eggnog. 
Jason sometimes even dressed up as Santa Claus for fun, and entertained his nephews.
Winter also came at the end of a year. 
New Year's Day would come after Christmas. 
Jason also loved this holiday. 
It was a day to celebrate the new year to come, while reflecting on the past one. 
Jason always made New Year's resolutions. 
Every year he made a new resolution. 
This year he promised to go skydiving. 
Last year, he promised himself to lose twenty pounds. 
Jason always kept his New Year's resolution. 
He lost twenty pounds in three months. 
This year was no exception. 
He planned to sign up for skydiving lessons in January of next year.
Jason could not stop thinking about winter. 
He could not wait for it to come. 
It was going to be the best winter yet. 
Jason needed to wait five more months because it was barely mid July.

26. NO SMOKING

For the past week Elizabeth would come home from work and discover that her apartment smelled like cigarette smoke. 
She did not know where the smell was coming from. 
Elizabeth didn't smoke. 
No one else had the key to her apartment to smoke inside while she was at work. 
The smell of smoke especially bothered her because she had asthma.
One day Elizabeth stayed home from work because she was expecting a package. 
When she woke up that morning, the apartment smelled fine. 
At one in the afternoon, Elizabeth went into the kitchen to make a sandwich for lunch. 
That was when she noticed the smell of cigarette smoke. 
She called the building's superintendent. 
By the time he arrived at Elizabeth's apartment, the whole place smelled like cigarette smoke. 
The super told Elizabeth he was pretty sure the smoke was coming up though the vents from her new downstairs neighbor. 
The new neighbor was a smoker. 
The super told Elizabeth there was nothing to be done. 
The building was really old and the vents couldn't be sealed. 
It was also perfectly legal for the downstairs neighbor to smoke in his apartment. 
He suggested that Elizabeth buy an air filter and see if that would help.
Elizabeth bought an air filter but didn't find it to be enough. 
Her asthma was getting worse. 
Her clothes and furniture were beginning to smell like cigarette smoke, too. 
Elizabeth decided to go downstairs to talk to the neighbor. 
She was going to ask him not to smoke in his apartment. 
Elizabeth knocked on the door. 
When he opened the door, a huge wave of cigarette smoke came out. 
Elizabeth began coughing violently. 
The neighbor gave Elizabeth a disgusted look. 
"Are you trying to get me sick?" the neighbor asked her. 
Elizabeth couldn't believe what he was saying. 
"No, but you are," she said.

27. COMPOSTING

Ron was excited to show his wife Debbie what he had bought at the home improvement store. 
Debbie, however, was not impressed when she saw the big, black plastic bin. 
She thought it was a garbage can. 
"We have a garbage can already. Why did you get another one?" Debbie asked. 
She seemed annoyed.
Ron explained that it was not a garbage can. 
It was a compost bin. 
Ron explained that a compost bin was a place where they could put any organic waste, like fallen leaves, grass clippings, and fruit and vegetable peels. 
"Why can't we just throw that in the trash?" Debbie asked. 
She really didn't want extra work for herself. 
Ron explained that it was good for the environment. 
About 30% of all the garbage in the United States is made up of waste from food and yards. 
Not only would they produce less garbage, they would also make compost, which was rich soil. 
It would help Debbie's flowers. 
She could have the beautiful garden she always dreamed of. 
Ron explained that little by little inside the bin, the food scraps and green waste would create a pile. 
The pile would naturally break down.
"Where are we keeping this pile?" Debbie asked. 
Ron said the bin would go in the back yard. 
Debbie wasn't convinced. 
She was worried about rats and roaches. 
Ron explained that as long as they didn't put any meat scraps or oily items in the compost bin, then rats wouldn't be a problem. 
Roaches, however, were a natural part of the materials breaking down.
Ron was especially excited about what he bought to put in the compost bin. 
He pulled out a small box and gave it to Debbie. 
She opened it and screamed before dropping the box on the floor. 
The box was filled with worms.

----------------------------------------

28. GIVING A HAND

Jaime, a new immigrant, was attending his daughter's first performance in a school play. 
His daughter, Carol, was five years old. 
She was a kindergarten student at the local public school. 
Carol did not have a very big role in the school play. 
She was playing a rain cloud in a play about the drought in California. 
Carol had one line. 
Her line was, " I am sad enough to cry about how dry the state is."
Jaime and his wife made sure to arrive early so that they could get a good seat in the auditorium. 
They secured seats in the front row. 
Before the show began, the school principal made an introductory speech. 
The speech was about how hard the students and teachers worked together to make the play possible. 
At the end of the speech, the principal said, "Let's give the school staff a hand".
Jaime, whose English was not very good, stood up when the principal said this. 
He knew that when people said "to give someone a hand" they meant they needed help. 
Jaime always wanted to help, especially at his daughter's school. 
Jaime thought maybe they needed help backstage.
Jaime's wife put her arm in front of her husband. 
"Where are you going?" she whispered. 
"They need a hand," Jaime whispered back. 
His wife explained that "to give someone a hand" could also mean to applaud someone. 
"They don't need help. They just want us to clap," Jaime's wife said. 
Jaime felt a little embarrassed. 
He sat back down and began clapping along with the rest of the audience.
Jaime thought to himself that someone needed to give the English language a hand. 
How could one phrase mean two different things? 
He meant the English language needed help.

----------------------------------------

29. ARRESTED TWICE IN ONE DAY

Donald had a rough morning. 
He had an argument with his wife, so he thought it would be a good idea to finish a six-pack of beer and a handful of prescription pain pills. 
This would have been fine if he had stayed inside his house. 
Instead, drunk and high, Donald began to harass his next-door neighbor. 
First he banged on his neighbor's door. 
Then he broke the glass panel of a porch light. 
Finally he ripped the light's wires out of the wall. 
That was the last straw. 
The neighbor called the police. 
The police came and arrested Donald for public intoxication and disturbing the peace. 
Donald was taken to a nearby jail. 
His stay only lasted a few hours. 
As soon as he was more sober, the police released him. 
Apparently, Donald wasn't quite sober enough though.
When he was released, Donald realized he was pretty far from his home. 
He didn't feel like walking almost two miles, so he called his friend from the jail to come get him. 
But Donald was getting impatient. 
When a woman got out of her car in the parking lot, he tried to get in. 
The woman screamed for help. 
Donald screamed, "But this is my car!" The woman kept screaming and Donald got out. 
He then thought it would be a good idea to take the bus home. 
A deputy was watching and arrested Donald again, after he had only been free for one hour. 
This time, however, Donald's jail stay would not be as short. 
He was charged with attempted burglary. 
A judge set his bail at $10,000. 
He didn't have $10,000, so he is still in jail awaiting trial.

30. WHAT'S GOOD FOR THE GOOSE

Rob Hernandez thought the fuzzy little chick at the pet shop was the cutest thing he had ever seen. 
He had to buy it. 
He thought he was buying a baby duck, and named his new pet Chaco. 
Chaco was loved and grew fast. 
Rob began to notice, however, that Chaco was growing too fast and getting too big. 
When Chaco made his first sound, Rob couldn't believe his ears. 
Rob expected a quack, but Chaco honked. 
Chaco was no duck. Chaco was a goose.
Rob didn't reject Chaco though. 
He kept him as long as he could. 
Chaco was not a quiet goose. 
He made a lot of noise, honking day and night. 
Rob's neighbors started to complain. 
Rob didn't want to give Chaco up, but he couldn't risk his neighbors calling the police on him either. 
Rob had to make a decision.
Rob decided to take Chaco to a nearby park that had a lake with other geese. 
Rob felt sad leaving Chaco and he was pretty sure his feathered friend felt sad, too. 
Rob goes twice a week to the park to visit Chaco so that both the goose and the owner are less sad. 
When Rob goes to visit, Chaco swims across the lake right into Rob's arms. 
Sometimes, Chaco will even give Rob a little peck, a goose's way of giving a kiss.
When Rob goes to visit, he always brings snacks for Chaco. 
The other geese seemed to be jealous of all the attention Chaco was getting, so now Rob brings enough bread for all the geese to share. 
Rob and Chaco also play. 
Rob throws his former pet into the lake. 
Chaco goes underwater, swims a little, and then returns to the shore so that Rob can throw him in again.

----------------------------------------

31. NO SUCH THING AS FREE LUNCH

Ever since Mary moved to the United States one year ago, she often heard the phrase "no such thing as free lunch". 
While she understood this to mean that you can't get something for nothing, she heard other mothers at her child's school talking about the free lunch program.
"How much does it cost to enroll?" Mary asked the secretary at her child's school. 
The secretary smiled and told Mary that it didn't cost anything except a little bit of time. 
In order to find out if Mary's child was qualified to get free lunch at school, she had to fill out a form. 
The form was available in many languages besides English. 
It asked Mary basic questions like where she lived, how many children she had, and what her annual income was.
Filling out the form was easy, and Mary didn't have to include proof of her income. 
She was worried though if the information on the form would be shared with other agencies. 
The secretary told her that the information was not shared. 
If Mary made below a certain amount annually, her child could get free lunch not just during the school year, but also even during the summer, when there was no school.
Mary knew this would help her family. 
While Mary did work, she only worked part-time. 
Giving her child money for lunch every day did add up and impact the family budget.
After filling out and submitting the form back to the school secretary, Mary had to wait a month or two before finding out if she was qualified. 
A few weeks after she submitted the form, a letter arrived in the mail. 
The letter informed her that her child was qualified. 
The letter also told her that her child could also get free breakfast in school.

----------------------------------------

32. PAYING TO WIN

Tom noticed that every morning when he went to school, his mother would give him a letter to drop in the mailbox on the corner. 
"Who are you writing to so much?" he asked. 
"I'm just trying my luck," Tom's mother told him.
A few weeks after Tom started mailing out the letters, he noticed that his mother was getting a lot more mail. 
Some of the mail advertised on the envelope that she might already be a winner. 
His mother was also getting many more magazines. 
Some of the magazines were about things his mother didn't eve care about, like cats.
"Mom, why are you getting so many magazines?" Tom asked her. 
She told him that she had been entering contests and that part of the process included subscribing to magazines. 
"It will increase my chances of winning the jackpot," she told him. 
Soon the family mailbox was filled with more contests announcements, magazines, and bills.
Tom's mother was surprised. 
She didn't think that checking off the boxes of magazines that looked interesting and affixing stickers to the return forms would cost her. 
She was spending more and more money and hadn't won anything. 
She wanted to be like the people in the commercials she saw on television. 
People bringing balloons and oversized checks surprised those people who entered the contests. 
Tom read the fine print. 
The magazines weren't free and Tom's mother was not increasing her chances of winning anything by subscribing. 
Tom did some research and found out there had even been lawsuits against the companies running the contests and selling the magazine subscriptions.
Tom's mother felt bad. 
"It pays to win, mom, but you can't pay to win," Tom told her. 
Tom's mother wondered what she was going to do with all these magazines.
