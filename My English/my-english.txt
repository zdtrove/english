My name is Hoang An.
I was born in Tien Giang province but currently I live in District 5, Ho Chi Minh City. 
I've lived here for 10 years now.
My family has 6 people, including my parents, my three older sisters and me.
We're willing to help together and my family is very happy.
At present, I am 29 years old and I'm working at a technology company.
My hobbies are playing chess, badminton and jogging.
Also, in my free time I also like listening to music, watching movies, reading and hang out with friends.
I used to study at the University of Science in Ho Chi Minh City.
My major is computer science.
I graduated in 2014.
I am a software development engineer and I have been working in this field for 6 years.
My company is quite small, only about 30 people.
My team consists of 6 members, a BSE, a leader, two backend engineers, 2 frontend engineers including me.
The project I'm developing is an animal project called Dogrun.
It is a system where users can register a place to walk the dog.
