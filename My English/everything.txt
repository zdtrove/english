1. Today is boring, I worked hard all day and now I want to go home and see my girlfriend right now.

2. The pandemic is everywhere, the streets are empty, most people are at home, only a few go out to buy food or do things that are really necessary.

3. I have aquarium fish and grow some ornamental plants at home, I feed the fish and water the plants every day.

4. My girlfriend and I haven't been able to go out for a long time because the pandemic is still heavy.

5. The wind is so cool, I want to go out for a walk.

6. It's raining so hard, I can't go home now, I'm sheltering under someone's eaves.

7. My girlfriend is sighing, I don't know what she's worried about.

8. The room I live in is quite small, it's just big enough for 2 people and some furniture.

9. I went to the supermarket last week, I bought enough food for a week, including rice, meat, fish, eggs, milk, vegetables.

11. I wake up every day at 7 am, then I will clean myself, prepare breakfast and lunch, and at 7:45 am I go to work by motorbike.

12. I want to be very good at English so that I can find a new job with a high salary to stabilize my life soon

13. Sometimes I want to go out for coffee with my friends, but most of my friends are busy so I usually go to coffee alone.

14. Near my house there is a convenience store, which sells many things from food, water, vegetables, etc. I can walk there to buy necessary things.

15. There are many food stalls around my house, but I like to cook for myself, so I mostly eat at home rather than eating out.

16. After coming home from work, I usually cook my own dinner, after dinner I will relax a bit by reading stories or watching videos, then I will study English.

17. There are five people in my family, my mother, my three older sisters and me.
